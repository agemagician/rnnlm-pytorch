Africa accounts for only 5 % of China ’ s overall foreign trade and investment .
This is dwarfed by China ’ s investment in the US , for example , where it has accumulated $ 1.3 trillion in US government debt alone .
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has been explicit about his country ’ s desire to form a progressive relationship with the continent , based on mutual respect , with a commitment to develop African communities .
It is instructive that , although Africa accounts for only a small fraction of China ’ s foreign investment , it has received nearly half of China ’ s total foreign aid .
For Africa , the focus must be on building the right environment for investment .
In building ties with Asia , African governments have an opportunity to learn from the region ’ s economic success stories , while boosting their own countries ’ industrial development .
Much of Asia ’ s investment in Africa has focused on infrastructure that directly supports African priorities : telecoms , power plants and transmission lines , water and sanitation , roads and railways , ports , aviation , and airports .
These investments represent a long-term commitment , and Africa benefits in many ways , gaining not only jobs today , but also a more advanced industrial base that will underpin employment and drive economic growth long into the future .
These investments also support Africa ’ s drive toward greater mobility , higher productivity , and a more prominent role in world trade .
And , by fostering competition for projects and mobilizing a more diverse pool of investors , they have enhanced Africa ’ s economic security .
Of course , short-term investment and economic growth cannot come at the expense of medium-term social development and job creation or long-term sustainability and stability .
We understand this , and so do our partners .
It is the responsibility of all African governments to ensure that investments and partnerships – whether with emerging-market investors such as China , Brazil , India , and the Gulf states , or with Europe and the US – are built on fair terms .
To see the ties between Africa and Asia as part of a battle between East and West is simplistic , outdated , and , above all , wrong-headed .
Greater interest in the continent is the result of reforms that have emboldened foreign investors – from both East and West – and of Africa ’ s growing ability to get the best deal for its economy and people .
Three Humanitarian Challenges for Africa in 2018
NAIROBI – In mid-2017 , when a cholera outbreak in Somalia threatened to overwhelm local hospitals , health experts feared the worst .
With crippling drought , malnutrition , and poverty already endemic , an outbreak of deadly diarrhea seemed destined to paralyze the fragile state .
But , despite the dire predictions , institutional paralysis was avoided .
Although hundreds died and many more became sick , the collective response managed by governments , NGOs , and local communities , including the national Red Crescent Societies supported by the Red Cross movement , contained the disease .
Somalia ’ s experience gives me great hope for Africa ’ s future .
But it also serves as a reminder that local capacity is easily inundated during times of crisis .
While some parts of Africa have become self-sufficient in terms of public health , others continue to lean heavily on global aid .
For these areas , partnership is the best means of minimizing risks .
In particular , three key challenges this year are likely to pose the severest tests of Africa ’ s ability to manage humanitarian crises .
The first challenge is violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
Last year , conflict in the DRC ’ s central Kasai region displaced some 1.4 million people , bringing the total displaced population to 4.1 million – the largest concentration of internal refugees anywhere in Africa .
The violence has exacerbated food insecurity , with more than three million people severely undernourished .
Unfortunately , the Kasai crisis is expected to worsen in 2018 .
A recent assessment by the Red Cross Society of the DRC warns that the number of people displaced will continue to rise , and with a fast-spreading cholera outbreak threatening the region , a coordinated plan of action is urgently needed .
The second challenge this year is Somalia ’ s food insecurity , which , according to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network , is expected to intensify this year .
Below-average rainfall in 2017 stunted harvests , and most regions have not fully recovered .
As humanitarian aid is channeled to the country , efforts must be made to target long-term solutions , such as improving agricultural output , educational access , and economic opportunity .
Historically , most aid to the country has been earmarked for emergency relief ; even the collective cholera response was narrowly focused on short-term health .
But Somalia desperately needs a more holistic , long-term development strategy .
Finally , the very scourge that Somalia contained last year will continue to rear its head elsewhere in the region .
Yemen ’ s cholera outbreak is now the largest in history , having already surpassed one million confirmed cases , and , despite years of international assistance , the threat continues to stalk Africa .
In the last four decades , African countries reported over three million suspected cholera cases to the World Health Organization and new cases are cropping up this year in Africa ’ s east-central and southern regions .
Fortunately , there is hope that Somalia ’ s containment success in 2017 can be replicated , provided that communities and individuals are well aware of the disease and related risks , and that local actors receive the needed resources .
The Global Task Force on Cholera Control , which seeks to build local and international support for improved health care and sanitation , has published a global roadmap for ending cholera by 2030 .
Although that is an ambitious target , it is achievable if international organizations and local governments work together .
Natural and manmade crises will continue to plague Africa , but organizations like mine are working hard to bring about a brighter future through improved capacity building .
To succeed , however , local and international development partners must reorient their thinking ; humanitarian aid alone will not solve Africa ’ s myriad challenges .
While money is clearly needed , it must be spent more strategically to improve structural weaknesses that perpetuate instability .
For example , if more funding were devoted to community-level health care projects , local organizations would be better positioned to lead when outbreaks threaten .
Put simply , the international development community must do more to invest in grassroots solutions , empowering Africans rather than treating them as subcontractors to their own suffering .
Not only are local organizations better positioned to navigate complex cultural and linguistic landscapes ; they also have more to lose if they fail .
Last year was devastating for many Africans , as millions suffered from drought , hunger , and violence .
But in Somalia , a coordinated response to a serious health threat offered new hope for a more secure future .
When local ingenuity and international support align , the cycle of suffering can be broken .
For many African countries , the ability to look confidently beyond the next crisis is the first step on the long road to self-reliance .
Africa , Climate Change , and the G-8 Summit
British Prime Minister Tony Blair has declared that the two issues at the center of the G-8 Summit this July will be African poverty and global climate change .
These may seem to be distinct issues .
In fact , they are linked .
A trip I took to a village in the Tigre region in northern Ethiopia shows why .
One morning , I was taken to a dry riverbed at the village ’ s edge .
Farmers were digging a pit in the riverbed , down to the water table approximately two meters below ground level .
They explained that until recently this was a perennial river – one that flows throughout the year – but now the river stops flowing during the dry season .
Only when the annual rains begin in the summer does water reappear in the river bed .
Until then , water-starved communities dig for water , if they can find it and if they can afford to pump it out .
In northern Ethiopia , as in much of Africa , the rain cycle has changed markedly in recent years .
Ethiopian village life has long depended on two crops , one during a short rain in March and April , and the main crop during the long rain in the summer months .
In recent years , the short rains have failed entirely , and long rains have been erratic .
Hunger is omnipresent .
Perhaps half of the children are severely underweight .
Much of arid sub-Saharan Africa , notably in the Sahel ( the region just south of the Sahara desert ) , has experienced a pronounced drop in rainfall over the past quarter-century .
This decline coincided with a rise in the surface temperature of the neighboring Indian Ocean , a hint that the decline in rainfall is in fact part of the longer-term process of man-made global warming .
Failures of rainfall contribute not only to famines and chronic hunger , but also to the onset of violence when hungry people clash over scarce food and water .
When violence erupts in water-starved regions such as Darfur , Sudan , political leaders tend to view the problems in narrow political terms .
If they act at all , they mobilize peacekeepers , international sanctions , and humanitarian aid .
But Darfur , like Tigre , needs a development strategy to fight hunger and drought even more than it needs peacekeepers .
Soldiers cannot keep peace among desperately hungry people .
One course of action must be to help impoverished African regions to “ adapt ” to climate change and to escape the poverty trap .
Water-stressed regions like Ethiopia and Sudan can adapt , at least in part , through improved technologies such as “ drip irrigation , ” rainwater harvesting , improved water storage facilities , deep wells , and agro-forestry techniques that make best use of scarce rainfall .
Better land-management practices ( the re-planting of degraded forests , for example ) can recharge underground water aquifers .
Poor countries cannot afford these technologies on their own .
Nor should they have to .
Help for poor countries in Africa and elsewhere to adapt to climate change should not be described as charity or aid , but rather as compensation for damages being imposed on the poorest people on the planet .
Greater help for these countries to escape from extreme poverty has been promised for decades but has not been delivered .
In addition to adapting to climate change , the world must also reduce future risks to the planet by cutting back on emissions of greenhouse gases , which are the source of man-made climate change .
While adaptation to climate change is necessary – because it is already occurring – this is not enough .
If the world fails to mitigate future climate change , the effects of rising temperatures , increasing droughts , more numerous and severe tropical storms , rising sea levels , and a spread of tropical diseases will pose huge threats to the entire planet .
The famines in Ethiopia and the violence in Darfur suggest what can lie ahead .
The best way to reduce long-term climate change is to reduce carbon emissions .
There are at least three options : shift to non-carbon energy sources such as solar or nuclear energy ; capture and dispose of the carbon dioxide emitted at carbon-based power plants ; economize on energy use , for example by shifting to hybrid automobiles and trucks .
Most likely , all three of these methods will have to play a role .
The effort to reduce greenhouse gases will require decades of action , but , given the long lead times in overhauling the world ’ s energy systems , we must start now .
Rich countries need to lead the way .
It is ironic that the United States , which portrays itself as a friend of democracy and impoverished countries , gives the smallest share of its GNP in aid among the rich countries , and also refuses to participate in global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
This is especially ironic because African countries like Ethiopia stand steadfastly and bravely with the US in the fight for freedom and against terrorism , even as they struggle with hunger , disease , and famine .
Moreover , countries like Ethiopia are making valiant , indeed remarkable , efforts to overcome their problems , despite the lack of adequate , and long-promised , help from the world ’ s richest countries .
Africans suffering from hunger and drought , and indeed poor people everywhere , have a right to ask much more of the US and other rich countries .
Tony Blair is right to call on his rich-country colleagues to follow through on their unfulfilled promises .
Capitalizing on Africa ’ s Demographic Dividend
LOMÉ – Africa is home to the world ’ s youngest and fastest-growing population .
With as many as 20 million young people poised to join the workforce every year for the next three decades , the continent has an opportunity to shift the balance of local and global growth with a purpose : jobs .
But it is far from inevitable that it will do so .
For African countries to capitalize on this demographic dividend , the future workforce must be educated , trained , and have adequate employment opportunities .
Putting all the pieces in place will not be easy .
These are uncertain times for the global economy .
Trade tensions between the United States and China are threatening the integrity of global value chains , and Britain ’ s looming exit from the European Union has the potential to cause even more disruption .
The International Monetary Fund ’ s October forecast warns that as historic economic drivers stall , global growth this year and next could fall to 3.7 % , a decline of 0.2 percentage points from previous estimates .
But as this slowdown gets priced in by stock markets around the world , new drivers of growth will emerge .
Africa is well positioned to become one of them .
According to the World Bank , six of the world ’ s ten fastest-growing economies are in Africa .
Intra-African trade might be the gateway to future local and global growth , with the continent ’ s burgeoning population forging new opportunities across borders .
Most significantly , Africa ’ s labor force is on the verge of a dramatic expansion .
Today , 60 % of Africans are younger than 25 , and 41 % are under the age of 15 .
By 2050 , Africa ’ s youth population is expected to reach 840 million .
But this massive pool of potential talent is a double-edged sword .
Despite strong GDP growth over the last ten years , the majority of young people in Africa could not capture economic opportunities .
Furthermore , the African Union / OECD report Africa ’ s Development Dynamics 2018 highlights that if the underemployment trend continues , Africa ’ s young people will suffer the most .
Failing to employ Africa ’ s young people fully could marginalize an entire generation and lead them down a path of disruption for which we may not be prepared .
For countries to experience job-led long-term growth , the provision of quality opportunities in agriculture is vital .
If that does not happen , and quality jobs remain scarce , the economic expansion of which Africa is capable will not happen .
In other words , African governments are facing a deadline to match job growth with skills training .
Unfortunately , at the moment , few countries are addressing this challenge effectively .
According to the African Development Bank , the unemployment rate for young people in Africa is already double the rate for adults .
In fact , young people are being let down even before they start looking for work .
Too many primary schools suffer from crippling teacher shortages , for example , and gender discrimination prevents millions of girls from even attending high school .
To overcome these shortcomings will require significant investments of political and financial capital .
Some leaders are moving in this direction .
At the Paris Peace Forum ( PPF ) , held earlier this month , African and global leaders gathered to discuss the powerful idea that international cooperation is the key to tackling global challenges and ensuring durable peace .
On the sidelines of the PPF , the focus fell on African youth .
The AU-EU Youth Cooperation Hub , one of 119 projects selected to participate in the Forum , attended the meeting to discuss the AU-EU Youth Agenda .
Striving to involve young people across Africa and Europe in decisions that impact them , now and in the future , this initiative aims to showcase strategies for bringing Africa and Europe together to address challenges such as the demographic dividend .
One approach to capitalizing on Africa ’ s demographic boom is to expand the availability of training initiatives that pair employers ’ needs with African talent .
As a former fellow with the Ibrahim Leadership program , I can attest to the transformative power of top-tier educational schemes and their value as incubators for job-related skills .
Africa ’ s success relies on its ability to harness its demographic dividend by equipping its youth with technological and innovative skills , which will be a catalyst for economic growth .
This includes training and agriculture-focused programs to absorb skills along the value chains that connect raw materials to industries and markets across Africa .
By 2030 , one in every five people on the planet will be African .
Because of its size alone , Africa ’ s labor force will have the potential to drive global growth for decades .
But to do so , Africans must implement the necessary reforms today .
As our demographic dividend matures , governments , institutions , and organizations must help position young people for success .
If African countries can meet this challenge , prolonged economic growth – at home and abroad – will be the reward .
Africa ’ s Middle Passage to Development
YAOUNDÉ – When it comes to relations with China – and development strategies more generally – there are two opposing camps in Africa .
But the approach that will bring the most progress is a “ middle passage ” that smooths contradictions and offers a balanced , accommodative , and pragmatic vision behind which Africans can unite .
On one side of the issue are China optimists .
Cooperation with China , they argue , could enable Africa to chart its own development course , independent of Western policy prescriptions .
This group is sympathetic to the “ Beijing model ” of governance , which focuses on national sovereignty and state control .
On the other side are China pessimists .
They worry that the dynamic in Sino-African relations would always favor China .
They prefer the West ’ s democracy-oriented approach , which emphasizes individual rights , underpinned by the free market agenda embodied in the so-called Washington Consensus .
The third group comprises the “ China accommodators , ” who combine the optimists ’ goals with the pessimists ’ wariness .
They emphasize the need for a common African strategy toward China that minimizes the relationship ’ s asymmetries .
Represented by the New Partnership for Africa ’ s Development ( NEPAD ) , the accommodators champion democracy , the rule of law , and human rights ; but , like China , they oppose Western interference .
One reason that the principle of non-interference is so critical is that African countries , like China , have long suspected a distinct Western bias in the conception of “ fundamental human rights . ”
For example , as Western countries increasingly move to protect gay rights , the expectation has arisen that aid recipients follow suit , placing such rights above the “ national rights ” of the government .
In 2014 , the United States and Europe cut aid to Uganda , owing to a bill imposing penalties on homosexual activities .
A similar bias is evident in criticism by the West – and by Africa ’ s pro-Western China pessimists – of China ’ s so-called resource diplomacy in Africa .
After all , China ’ s approach is no different from America ’ s long-standing oil-based relationships with countries like Saudi Arabia .
And it is not as if the historical involvement in Africa of revered democracies like France was shaped by the values of “ liberty , equality , and fraternity . ”
In this context , while it is obviously critical that African countries protect their citizens ’ individual rights , external views of what constitutes such a right should not trump legitimate sovereign authority .
Similarly , international law should not create space for some countries to criticize and punish other countries regarding issues that are settled in accordance with domestic democracy and law .
This includes the selective application of law by the International Criminal Court .
Another clash that NEPAD aims to resolve is that between economic rights , or “ the right to bread , ” which the Beijing model supporters put first , and political rights , or “ the right to vote , ” emphasized by the pro-Western camp .
Here , the key is sequencing .
Given that a starving person would most likely give up their vote in exchange for some bread , one can surmise that a certain level of prosperity must be achieved before political rights become the top priority .
And , however committed the China pessimists are to free markets , there is no denying that China ’ s state-controlled economy has lifted millions of people out of poverty and created a rapidly burgeoning middle class .
This suggests that African countries , too , would benefit from a similar focus on economic growth , which will demand engagement with dynamic economies like China ’ s .
In fact , while the pessimists may not like the idea of closer ties with China , the reason it is necessary – economic globalization – actually derives from the Washington Consensus principles that they so cherish .
In any case , once a strong middle class has been established , the focus can shift toward building a credible and sustainable liberal democracy .
The need for a two-pronged approach to development , incorporating elements of the Beijing model and the Washington Consensus , has been underscored by the outcome of the Arab Spring revolts of 2011 .
A lack of economic opportunities was a major driver of the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tunisia , Egypt , and others .
But the belief that the right to vote would support the right to bread did not quite work out .
In fact , despite the overthrow of authoritarian regimes , Egypt has so far proved unable to build credible democratic governments or enforce the rule of law effectively , change in Tunisia remains tenuous , and Libya is substantially worse off – economically and politically – than it was before 2011 .
Perhaps if sovereign rights had been better respected , with outside powers supporting consensus-building processes instead of coups d ’ état , political breakthroughs could have been achieved , opening the way for economy-boosting initiatives against relatively stable backgrounds .
Yet the West seems not to have learned its lesson .
Indeed , it has long demanded that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad cede power before a credible peace process can begin .
Though Western leaders have softened their position in recent months , the damage has been done : Uncertain of his physical survival , Assad unleashed a horrific civil war , from which the Islamic State has benefited considerably .
And he remains in power .
None of this is to condone the repressive policies of the authoritarian leaders – from Egypt ’ s Hosni Mubarak to Libya ’ s Muammar el-Qaddafi – whose regimes were overthrown .
The point is rather to emphasize the potential benefits of a more stability-oriented approach , in which the drive to secure political rights is reconciled with the principles of respect for national and sovereign rights reflected in the Beijing model .
China ’ s growing involvement in Africa is important not just for the direct economic benefits it can provide , but also for the impact it can have on development strategies .
With an approach that merges Chinese and Western models – balancing human rights with national interests , individual rights with sovereign authority , and political rights with economic goals – African countries could enhance their development prospects considerably .
Africa ’ s Opportunity in Addis
DAKAR – This week , Addis Ababa , Ethiopia ’ s capital and a city full of symbolic importance for all of Africa , will host the Third International Conference on Financing for Development .
Most developing countries hold high expectations for the conference .
They hope it will offer new means to improve social welfare at a time when financing their development needs has become increasingly difficult .
For most African countries , the key challenge nowadays is structural economic transformation .
Simply put , our economies must be able to create enough good jobs to employ growing populations .
Africa is home to one billion people , 74 % of whom are younger than 24 , and 61.3 % of whom are women .
The United Nations predicts that by 2040 , just one generation from now , Africa ’ s total population will exceed two billion – 70.1 % under the age of 25 , with women accounting for 57.7 % .
These young men and women need – and are increasingly demanding – high-quality education and jobs .
Thus , African governments must seize this opportunity to advocate for increased financing for sustainable development , building on the mobilization of more significant domestic revenue .
The good news is that there has been real progress on this front .
At both the national and regional levels , policymakers are paying greater attention to domestic resource mobilization as a means of leveraging the effectiveness of external assistance .
In this context , strengthening our countries ’ administrative capacity is critical , for it will enable us to make the best possible use of the financial and technical assistance provided by bilateral and multilateral institutions .
Nonetheless , the fact remains that , in addition to domestic financial resources , mobilization of external resources will be needed to meet additional financing needs and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals , the 15-year global framework that the UN will adopt in September .
Indeed , given the constraints on the capacity of most African countries to attract private financing , it is critical that the international community increase official development assistance ( ODA ) if the SDGs are to be achieved .
That is why we must encourage multilateral institutions such as the African Development Bank ( AfDB ) , the International Monetary Fund , and the World Bank to continue to improve African countries ’ access to their concessional and non-concessional resources .
They should also support our efforts to realign the existing frameworks for mobilizing ODA and ensure more timely and predictable access to external financing , along the lines established by the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness , which specifies guidelines for monitoring and measuring how donor financial assistance is used .
In this sense , the conference in Addis is being held at an opportune moment , because it coincides with efforts to revise the rules of the international tax system .
Some 14 countries , including Senegal , are involved in the implementation of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ( BEPS ) project , which seeks to create greater transparency in taxation regimes .
But we recognize that we must go beyond BEPS and address broader issues related to the fiscally costly tax incentives found in investment , mining , and petroleum codes .
These incentives often deprive our governments of resources that could be used to fund essential development projects .
The Addis meeting also provides a unique opportunity for a deeper analysis of issues related to illicit financial activities – another big drain on African treasuries .
Indeed , the revenue shortfalls induced by such activities are estimated to cost African countries between $ 30-60 billion a year , a sum that falls within the neighborhood of total ODA received by Africa ( $ 46.1 billion in 2012 ) .
Sadly , the problem has been getting worse in recent years .
That is why I welcome the US-Africa Partnership to Combat Illicit Finance , which aims to promote transparency in public financial management , combat corruption , strengthen judiciaries and the rule of law , and ensure greater accountability to civil-society and private-sector actors .
The partnership ’ s first meeting was held in Dakar on June 25 , with a view to establishing a working group comprising several African countries and observers from organizations such as the AfDB , the IMF , the World Bank , and the OECD .
Achieving greater transparency in public administration will require sustained implementation of projects – such as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative ( EITI ) , the Construction Sector Transparency Initiative , and others – that shine a spotlight on the behavior of governments and investors .
Similarly , revising mining and petroleum codes , as appropriate , could help improve transparency and ensure more equitable revenue-sharing arrangements between investors and the countries in which they operate .
This week ’ s conference in Addis Ababa should lay the foundation for more effective external financing of sustainable development over the course of the SDGs .
But the quality of what is built on that foundation will depend on the commitment and mobilization of all actors , particularly those from Africa .
Africa ’ s Path from Poverty
BEIJING – All low-income countries have the potential for dynamic economic growth .
We know this because we have seen it happen repeatedly : a poor , agrarian economy transforms itself into a middle- or even high-income urban economy in one or two generations .
The key is to capture the window of opportunity for industrialization arising from the relocation of light manufacturing from higher-income countries .
That was true in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , and it remains true today .
Japan seized its opportunity in the years following World War II , using labor-intensive industries , such as textiles and simple electronics , to drive its economy until rising labor costs eroded its comparative advantage in those sectors .
That shift then allowed other low-income Asian economies – South Korea , Taiwan , Hong Kong , Singapore , and to some extent Malaysia and Thailand – to follow in Japan &apos;s footsteps .
China , of course , is the region &apos;s most recent traveler along this well-trodden path .
After more than three decades of breakneck economic growth , it has transformed itself from one of the poorest countries on earth to the world &apos;s largest economy .
And now that China , too , is beginning to lose its comparative advantage in labor-intensive industries , other developing countries – especially in Africa – are set to take its place .
Indeed , ever since the Industrial Revolution , the rise of light manufacturing has driven a dramatic rise in national income .
The United Kingdom &apos;s economic transformation started with textiles .
In Belgium , France , Sweden , Denmark , Italy , and Switzerland , light manufacturing led the way .
Similarly , in the United States , cities like Boston , Baltimore , and Philadelphia became centers for producing textiles , garments , and shoes .
Until recently , few believed that Africa , too , could become a center for modern manufacturing .
But , with the right policies , there is no reason why African countries could not follow a similar trajectory .
Consider land-locked Ethiopia , which only ten years ago seemed to be an especially bad bet .
But then the country built an industrial park near Addis Ababa and invited the Chinese shoemaker Huajian to open a factory there .
Huajian opened its doors in January 2012 with two production lines and some 600 workers .
By the end of the year , it had employed 2,000 Ethiopians and doubled the country &apos;s exports of leather shoes .
Today , the company has 3,500 workers in Ethiopia producing more than two million shoes a year .
In 2013 , spurred by Huajian &apos;s success , the Ethiopian government created a new industrial park , with space for 22 factory units .
Within three months , all of them had been leased by export-oriented companies from Turkey , Korea , Taiwan , China , and elsewhere .
The World Bank has provided $ 250 million to support the continued construction of these industrial parks .
The Ethiopian success story is just the start .
As investors learn more about Africa , they will increasingly see what it has to offer .
Indeed , the cost of labor in Africa is competitive enough that Ethiopia could attract companies from countries as poor as Bangladesh .
Africa has a surplus of agricultural labor and too few other jobs .
As foreign firms launch operations in the labor-intensive sectors in which Africa has a comparative advantage , they will train the local workforce .
Some workers will become managers .
They will become familiar with the technology and learn how to maintain consistent quality in the production line .
They will establish contacts with international buyers and investors .
And , eventually , some of them will be able to raise capital and start firms of their own – export companies owned and operated by Africans .
Mauritius shows the path ahead .
In the 1970s , the government set up industrial parks to process textiles and garments for export .
At the time , most of the owners were from Taiwan or Hong Kong ; today , more than 70 % of the island &apos;s industrial companies are locally owned .
A carefully focused export strategy is crucial .
The international development community and many African governments want to work toward regional integration , linking the markets of 55 African countries .
This might have its advantages , but it should not be a priority .
Africa today accounts for just 1.9 % of global GDP , compared to 21 % for the United States and 23 % for Europe .
Developing countries must use their limited resources in the most effective way , and there is no question where the most attractive opportunities in Africa are to be found .
For example , instead of investing heavily in the infrastructure needed for regional integration , a country like Ethiopia would be better off building industrial parks and linking them by road to ports in Djibouti .
With the right growth strategy , far-reaching change can come within a person &apos;s lifetime – sometimes more than once .
My native Taiwan is now a high-income economy .
But when I was born there , in 1952 , the island was poorer than almost every country in Africa .
Then it happened to me again .
I moved to mainland China in 1979 , when the country &apos;s per capita income was less than one-third of Sub-Saharan Africa &apos;s .
Today , China has become an upper-middle-income country , and it is on track to become a high-income country by 2020 .
My hope is that I can witness a third economic transformation in my lifetime , this time in Ethiopia and other countries in Africa .
If they stay on the tried and tested path of those who have gone before , there is every chance that I will .
The Promise of Digital Health
BASEL – Africa has changed remarkably , and for the better , since I first worked as a young doctor in Angola some 20 years ago .
But no change has been more obvious than the way the continent has adopted mobile technology .
People in Africa – and , indeed , throughout low- and middle-income countries – are seizing the opportunities that technology provides , using mobile phones for everything from making payments to issuing birth certificates , to gaining access to health care .
The benefit of mobile technologies lies in access .
Barriers like geographical distance and low resources , which have long prevented billions of people from getting the care they need , are much easier to overcome in the digital age .
And , indeed , there are countless ways in which technology can be deployed to improve health-care access and delivery .
Of course , this is not new information , and a growing number of technology-based health initiatives have taken shape in recent years .
But only a few have reached scale , and achieved long-term sustainability ; the majority of projects have not made it past the pilot phase .
The result is a highly fragmented landscape of digital solutions – one that , in some cases , can add extra strain to existing health systems .
The first step to addressing this problem is to identify which factors breed success – and which impede it .
Here , perhaps the most important observation relates to how the solution is linked to the reality on the ground .
After all , technology is an enabler for the innovation of health-care delivery , not an end in itself .
Solutions that focus on end-users , whether health practitioners or patients , have the best chance of succeeding .
Fundamental to this approach is the recognition that what users need are not necessarily the most advanced technologies , but rather solutions that are easy to use and implement .
In fact , seemingly outdated technologies like voice and text messages can be far more useful tools for the intended users than the latest apps or cutting-edge innovations in , say , nanotechnology .
Consider the Community-based Hypertension Improvement Project in Ghana , run by the Novartis Foundation , which I lead , and FHI 360 .
The project supports patients in self-managing their condition through regular mobile medication reminders , as well as advice on necessary lifestyle changes .
This approach is successful because it is patient-centered and leverages information and communication technology ( ICT ) tools that are readily available and commonly used .
In a country where mobile penetration exceeds 80 % but only a few people have smartphones , such simple solutions can have the greatest impact .
For health practitioners , digital solutions must be perceived as boosting efficiency , rather than adding to their already-heavy workload .
Co-creating solutions with people experienced in delivering health care in low-resource settings can help to ensure that the solutions are adopted at scale .
For example , the telemedicine network that the Novartis Foundation and its partners rolled out with the Ghana Health Service was a direct response to the need , expressed by health-care practitioners on the ground , to expand the reach of medical expertise .
The network connects frontline health workers with a simple phone call to consultation centers in referral hospitals several hours away , where doctors and specialists are available around-the-clock .
From the outset , the project was a response to an expressed need to expand the reach of medical expertise , and was fully operated on the ground by Ghana Health Service staff , which made this model sustainable at scale .
To realize the full potential of digital health , solutions need to be integrated into national health systems .
Only then can digital technology accelerate progress toward universal health coverage and address countries ’ priority health needs .
Collaboration across the health and ICT sectors , both public and private , is essential .
Multidisciplinary partnerships driven by the sustained leadership of senior government officials must guide progress , beginning at the planning stage .
Intra-governmental collaboration , dedicated financing for digital health solutions , and effective governance mechanisms will also be vital to successful strategies .
Digital technologies offer huge opportunities to improve the way health care is delivered .
If we are to seize them , we must learn from past experience .
By remaining focused on the reality of end-users and on priority health needs , rather than being dazzled by the latest technology , we can fulfil the promise of digital health .
Confronting Africa ’ s Water Challenge
ABIDJAN – Water is essential for life , and yet it is scarce in many parts of the world .
Owing to the effects of climate change , Africa is experiencing its worst drought since 1945 , especially in Southern Sudan , Somalia , Ethiopia , and Northern Nigeria .
These fragile areas now need the global community ’ s support .
We need to build resilient systems to ensure access to potable water for all people , and to improve water-delivery and sanitation provisions in Africa ’ s rapidly growing urban areas .
We should begin by expanding Africans ’ capacity to harness wastewater .
With investment and proper management , wastewater can become a sustainable source of wealth for many Africans , with added benefits for human health , agricultural productivity , and environmental sustainability .
Over the past six years , the African Development Bank has invested $ 3.3 billion in projects to expand access to water and improve sanitation , with around $ 2.2 billion of that going to urban services that reach at least 17 million people .
The AfDB supports an integrated urban water-management model ( IUWM ) that , in keeping with United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 , enables communities to derive a sustainable income from management of urban liquid and solid waste .
IUWM efforts require a significant initial investment , and come with steep capital and operational costs .
Only a few African cities collect and treat any more than 20 % of the wastewater generated through centralized wastewater-management systems .
The remaining 80 % constitutes a huge untapped source of potentially valuable liquid and solid waste .
With the right investment , foresight , and commitment , this underappreciated resource can create jobs and deliver sustainable growth .
Wastewater management is thus a central feature of the AfDB ’ s strategic priorities , known as the High 5s , which aim to improve Africans ’ quality of life , boost public health , achieve gender equality , create jobs , and increase communities ’ resilience to the effects of climate change .
Water will also play a key role in reaching the High 5s ’ industrialization and sustainable-farming objectives .
In Yaoundé , Cameroon , the AfDB helped to protect some 300,000 people and their property by reducing the frequency of floods from 15 incidents per year to just three .
And with a $ 40 million sanitation project , the AfDB helped to lower the proportion of the city ’ s malaria-afflicted population from 16 % to 12 % .
In Abidjan , Côte d ’ Ivoire , the $ 23 million AfDB-funded Gourou Basin Integrated Watershed Management Project significantly reduced flooding throughout the Gourou Basin , and improved 2.8 million inhabitants ’ livelihoods .
In Zimbabwe , after 4,300 people died in the 2008-2009 cholera pandemic , the AfDB and other donors supported the $ 43.6 million Urgent Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project , which made emergency repairs to wastewater systems in urban areas , helping 2.5 million people .
All AfDB-supported wastewater-management systems follow sustainability strategies to ensure that they enhance economic gains , benefit local communities , and remain affordable .
These projects also help countries to harness and use waste flows , by converting sewage to biogas and fertilizer .
Meanwhile , the AfDB ’ s African Water Facility ( AWF ) complements its project-finance work by attracting downstream investments in water infrastructure .
In February , flooding and strong winds from Tropical Storm Dineo devastated the coast of Mozambique and had a severe impact on the local population .
But just a few weeks later , the AWF launched a feasibility study to improve livelihoods and climate-change resilience throughout Mozambique ’ s Inhambane Province , where the storm struck .
In collaboration with the Global Water Partnership , the AWF is implementing IUWM systems in five African cities , including Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Marondera in Zimbabwe .
In the DRC alone , IUWM systems can be expected to improve water delivery and sanitation for 17 million people by 2030 .
The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation is also tapping into the AfDB ’ s expertise , by providing an $ 18 million grant to fund Phase II of the AfDB ’ s Urban Sanitation Program .
This effort will help to develop business innovations for affordable and sustainable sanitation services in Africa , which could reach two million urban dwellers directly and another six million people through subsidiary projects .
Africa ’ s wastewater-management challenges are substantial and complex .
But the AfDB is determined to provide opportunities that pay dividends for African communities – in public health , improved sanitation , economic development , and environmental protection .
Improving the quality of life for all Africans will require political commitment , public-private partnerships , and robust public involvement .
With the High 5s framework , the AfDB is working to bring these three ingredients together .
All stakeholders – in Africa and internationally – must redouble our efforts to ensure clean , affordable water for all , and to support African countries suffering through a historic drought .
We have a moral obligation to do so .
After all , water means life .
Is Africa Still Rising ?
WASHINGTON , DC – Between 2000 and 2014 , Africa grew at a strong clip , fueling belief in the narrative of an “ Africa rising . ”
But , since 2015 , growth across Sub-Saharan Africa has weakened , and the poor outlook for commodity prices has cast doubt on Africa ’ s economic promise , leading many to question the “ Africa rising ” narrative – and some to pronounce it dead .
Such skepticism is , to some extent , understandable .
The 2014 oil-price shock hit several African economies especially hard , and played a role in pushing aggregate growth down from 5-6 % in 2004-2014 to just 2.5 % in 2015-2017 – a rate that barely keeps up with population growth .
Moreover , the continent &apos;s three largest economies – Angola , Nigeria , and South Africa – have experienced major declines in performance .
Last year , Angola and South Africa ’ s economies stagnated , while the Nigerian economy actually contracted for the first time since 1991 .
The latest projections suggest that these economies will experience tepid recoveries in the coming years .
But Africa ’ s skeptics have overlooked a number of important factors .
For starters , when one sets the three largest economies aside , Sub-Saharan Africa ’ s aggregate-growth rate for this year rises from 2.5 % to almost 4 % .
That is faster than the 3.5 % rate at which the global economy is currently growing .
In fact , five of the ten fastest-growing economies in the world are in Africa .
And over the next five years , around half of all Sub-Saharan economies will expand at an average rate similar to or higher than that which prevailed during the “ Africa rising ” heyday .
Furthermore , high commodity prices were just one factor in the region ’ s strong economic performance between 2000 and 2014 .
Many African countries have made vast improvements to macroeconomic management , governance , and the business environment , and entrepreneurship is on the rise .
Even with lower commodity prices , these developments will continue to bolster many African economies .
Today ’ s skepticism may reflect lasting memories from a darker period , and fears that Africa ’ s progress has not been sufficiently consolidated .
From the 1970s to the mid-1990s , dictators ruled in many African countries , and the institutions necessary for sustaining strong economic growth were fragile at best .
With civil wars constantly shredding the social fabric in many countries , the continent experienced decades of tepid economic growth .
By 2000 , it had been reduced to what The Economist called “ Hopeless Africa . ”
But those days are gone .
Policymakers across the continent have sustained the 1990s-era reforms that set the stage for the subsequent period of high growth .
Although there is still much work to be done , the economic and business environment in many African countries has continued to improve , and institutions and governance have grown stronger .
Owing to new information and communication technologies , Africans , particularly young Africans , are better informed , more engaged in civil and political discourse , and increasingly capable of holding their leaders accountable .
ICTs have also unleashed a wave of innovation and entrepreneurship across the continent .
These positive trends are not likely to be reversed , and will continue to improve the economic conditions in Africa , even if commodity prices do not rebound .
After all , the region ’ s economic growth averaged 5.6 % between 2000 and 2004 , before commodity prices had begun their rapid ascent .
But that is not to say Africa will be spared from daunting challenges in the years ahead .
Globally , the economic environment will become less favorable for African economies .
In the major advanced economies , interest rates will soon rise , and the political backlash against globalization may force governments to abandon their past commitments to development assistance .
In light of all this uncertainty , African policymakers should look inward , by focusing on policies to mobilize national resources and finance their economic agendas .
Those agendas should include a number of key priorities .
African countries need to diversify their economies to withstand future shocks better , while also accelerating the pace of industrialization across the continent .
Governments will have to find a way to create decent jobs for the 11 million people now entering the region ’ s labor force every year .
And they will need to enact policies to reduce poverty , and ensure that prosperity is shared across all cohorts of society .
These are particularly important goals for Angola , Nigeria , and South Africa .
Angola and Nigeria need to become far less reliant on oil ; and South Africa still needs to implement far-reaching reforms to address structural problems that have plagued it since the apartheid era .
Seeing these projects through will require competent political leaders who are committed to the principles of good governance .
Failure could result in an extended period of low growth .
But even if Africa ’ s three largest economies do end up in the doldrums , it will not necessarily seal the fate of the “ Africa rising ” story .
After all , “ Africa rising ” need not mean “ all ” of Africa .
From the 1960s to the 1990s , the “ Asian Tigers ” narrative referred only to Hong Kong , Singapore , South Korea , and Taiwan , excluding other developing countries in Asia , such as China .
Similarly , African economies are increasingly differentiating themselves , and should thus be evaluated individually , on the merits of their respective economic policies .
Africa Still Rising
JOHANNESBURG – Is the honeymoon over for African economies ?
Less than a decade ago , it seemed that the continent ’ s economic dreams were beginning to come true , with many countries experiencing impressive GDP growth and development .
Now , as the harsh reality of the continent ’ s vulnerability to challenging external conditions has set in , sustaining that growth has proved difficult .
Encumbered by slowing growth in China , a collapse in commodity prices , and adverse spillover from numerous security crises , Africa ’ s overall annual GDP growth averaged just 3.3 % in 2010-2015 , barely keeping up with population growth – and down sharply from the 4.9 % recorded from 2000 to 2008 .
But a deeper look suggests that things may not be as bad as they seem , for two key reasons .
First , though average growth has declined , some African economies have thrived in recent years .
Indeed , aggregate GDP has been dragged down since 2010 by faltering growth among oil exporters and security-related crises in the Sahel and North Africa ; but in the rest of Africa , GDP growth has accelerated , from 4.1 % in 2000-2010 to 4.4 % in 2010-2015 .
Second , Africa is undergoing a profound long-term transformation , characterized by rapid digitization , urbanization , and growth in the working-age population , which will outnumber the labor force of China and India by 2034 .
That demographic trend could unlock future growth by advancing economic diversification , spurring domestic consumption , and supporting industrialization .
In fact , today ’ s high-growth countries – including Côte d ’ Ivoire , Ethiopia , Kenya , and Tanzania – have made substantial progress in reducing their dependence on commodity exports , in favor of trade , investment , and domestic consumption .
And many lower-growth countries could head down a similar path .
New research by the McKinsey Global Institute ( MGI ) shows that spending by Africa ’ s consumers and businesses already totals $ 4 trillion .
By 2025 , private spending could reach $ 5.6 trillion – $ 2.1 trillion by households , and $ 3.5 trillion by businesses .
This represents a huge opportunity for Africa � � � s manufacturers .
We believe that Africa can almost double its manufacturing output , to nearly $ 1 trillion , by 2025 , with about 75 % of that growth tied to production for local markets .
The question is whether manufacturers will manage to exploit the growth potential that lies in front of them .
African firms have not yet proved capable of meeting existing domestic demand .
Africa still imports about one-third of the food , beverages , and similar processed goods it consumes , whereas the Association of Southeast Asian Nations imports about 20 % , and South America ’ s Mercosur trade bloc imports just 10 % .
Africa even imports 15 % of the cement it uses , despite having abundant raw materials to make it at home .
To be sure , African business has made great strides in recent years .
Today , 400 African companies have annual revenue of more than $ 1 billion , and 700 have annual revenue of more than $ 500 million .
On the whole , these large companies are growing faster – and generating higher profits – than their global peers .
But there is still a long way to go .
Large African ( excluding South African ) firms ’ average annual revenue of $ 2 billion is half that of large firms in Brazil , India , Mexico , and Russia .
And Africa only has about 60 % of the large firms it needs to put it at the same level as the emerging economies .
One key factor limiting firms ’ growth is the fragmented nature of the African market , which currently comprises mostly small economies with only limited economic and political linkages .
There are eight partly overlapping regional trade zones , none of which includes more than half of Africa ’ s countries .
Only Egypt , Morocco , Nigeria , and South Africa rank in the top 100 of MGI ’ s Global Connectedness Index .
Beyond excessive trade barriers , Africa suffers from inadequate transport links and limits on the free movement of people .
Africans need visas to travel to more than half the countries on their own continent .
The recent launch of the African Union passport is a step in the right direction – but it is only one step .
A more integrated market would not only enable African companies to create the economies of scale they need to compete ; it would also be far more appealing to institutional investors .
Building such a market must therefore be a top priority for African leaders , as they seek to unleash the continent ’ s economic potential .
Equally important , Africa ’ s leaders must work to improve the business environment .
Though some progress has been made on this front in the last two decades , non-tariff barriers remain high .
Indeed , regulatory issues are still cited as a serious deterrent to investment .
Many African businesses – nearly half of companies in Nigeria , and more than one-third in Angola and Egypt – highlight unreliable electricity supplies as a major challenge .
And almost 40 % of firms surveyed by the World Bank lament the constraints imposed by competition from informal firms .
Some of these issues could be addressed relatively quickly .
Consider the strides Rwanda has made since 2007 , when it established a development board to improve its business environment .
In less than a decade , that board has led the creation of a “ one-stop center ” to facilitate investment , has overseen streamlined issuance of construction permits , and has pressed successfully for a fixed fee for property registration , the extension of customs hours , and risk-based customs inspections .
As a result , Rwanda ’ s global ranking for the ease of doing business jumped from 143 in 2008 to 32 in 2014 .
This success can surely be replicated elsewhere in Africa .
Despite the challenges some African countries face , the continent ’ s economic potential remains massive , thanks to favorable demographic dynamics , fast-growing cities , burgeoning domestic markets , and a digital revolution .
With the right policies , a relentless focus on execution , and a great deal of determination , Africa can still rise .
Africa ’ s Arrival
NEW YORK – The African Development Bank ( AfDB ) has just published its African Economic Outlook for 2018 .
This year ’ s revamped publication – shorter than usual , analytically well-structured , and written in lucid prose , without hyperbole – in some ways mirrors Africa ’ s own transformation , as it raises hopes that we may at last be witnessing the continent ’ s long-promised economic arrival .
Africa ’ s rise has been a long time coming .
In the 1960s , hopes were high .
The remarkable leaders of the independence generation – such as Ghana ’ s Kwame Nkrumah and Kenya ’ s Jomo Kenyatta – received advice from the world ’ s top economists .
The Caribbean-born Nobel laureate Arthur Lewis became Nkrumah ’ s Chief Economic Adviser .
In India , we read about these leaders ’ friendship with our own post-independence prime minister , Jawaharlal Nehru , and the hope for a new dawn for all emerging economies .
And many emerging economies did indeed take off .
In the late 1960s , some East Asian economies surged ahead .
Beginning in the early 1980s , China began its decades-long rise .
And , from the early 1990s , India ’ s economy also began to grow robustly , with annual rates reaching the 9 % range by 2005 .
But Africa remained stagnant , mired in poverty .
Ironically , it was the continent ’ s resource wealth that hampered economic progress , as it fueled conflicts among governments and insurgents eager to control it .
The resulting political instability attracted outsiders keen to exploit governments ’ weakness .
As the Indian poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore put it in his 1936 poem “ Ode to Africa , ” which played on perceptions about who is “ civilized , ” the continent fell prey to “ civilization ’ s barbaric greed , ” as the colonists “ arrived , manacles in hand / Claws sharper by far than any of your wolves . ”
Finally , at the turn of the twenty-first century , things began to change for Africa .
A few dynamic leaders , democratic stirrings , and emerging regional cooperation led to a decline in poverty and a pickup in growth .
Commodity exporters faced a setback around 2014 , when prices plummeted .
But this turned out to be a blessing in disguise , because it forced countries to diversify their economies and increase production – factors that supported renewed growth .
According to the AfDB report , Africa ’ s 54 economies grew by 2.2 % in 2016 , on average , and 3.6 % in 2017 .
In 2018 , the AfDB predicts , average growth will accelerate to 4.1 % , while the World Bank expects Ghana to grow by 8.3 % , Ethiopia by 8.2 % , and Senegal by 6.9 % , placing these countries among the world ’ s fastest-growing economies .
And these figures are not wishful thinking : in 2016 , Ethiopia ’ s GDP grew by 7.6 % .
Of course , serious challenges remain .
South Africa , the continent ’ s strongest economy , is now facing the difficult task of tackling its deep-rooted corruption .
Yet , with the African National Congress now apparently determined to replace President Jacob Zuma ’ s scandal-ridden administration with one led by the party ’ s new leader , Cyril Ramaphosa , there is reason for hope .
More broadly , many African countries need to find ways to create more employment – and fast .
The share of the working-age population is rising faster in Africa than in any other region .
This “ demographic dividend ” has immense potential .
But if job creation stalls , the unemployed or under-employed are likely to become frustrated – a recipe for conflict .
Consider the case of Tanzania .
Thanks to President John Magufuli ’ s effort to mobilize more domestic revenue to support increased development spending , the economy is doing well .
But , with roughly 800,000 individuals entering the labor force each year , Tanzania needs much more working capital , better infrastructure , and educational reform aimed at ensuring that workers have the skills , resources , and opportunities to secure decent jobs .
The same is true of Ethiopia .
In the last couple of decades , the country has made great strides in export-led growth , supported by a growing industrial sector and large investments from China .
Now , it is poised to take over as the economic powerhouse of East Africa .
Yet the urban youth unemployment rate stands at 23.3 % .
Left unchecked , this situation could easily end up fueling ethnic conflict and political turmoil .
Another , related challenge concerns resource mobilization : countries need funds to invest in infrastructure , human capital , and the creation of trade and digital links within and beyond Africa .
The AfDB report estimates that , for infrastructure investment alone , the continent needs some $ 170 billion per year , which is $ 100 billion more than is currently available .
As it stands , Africa receives a total of about $ 60 billion in foreign direct investment each year .
To close the gap , African governments must attract more money .
That will require establishing effective regulatory structures that facilitate long-term borrowing and repayment , while ensuring that lenders do not exploit borrowers , as has occurred everywhere from rural India to the United States mortgage market .
The challenges are daunting , to say the least .
But there are lessons that African countries can learn from one another .
For example , Ghana ’ s smooth transfer of power after the December 2016 election set a positive democratic example .
Nigeria ’ s Lagos State and Tanzania have done a good job of mobilizing internal resources for development .
Add to that the emergence of an indigenous intelligentsia in the region , exemplified by organizations like the AfDB , and it seems that Africa ’ s moment may have arrived at last .
Uniting Against Malaria
LOMÉ / GABORONE – As African women leading influential and impact-driven organizations – the Ecobank Foundation and the African Leaders Malaria Alliance ( ALMA ) – we are passionate about building a prosperous , inclusive , and sustainable African economy .
But achieving that goal requires accelerating progress toward eradicating the diseases that continue to deplete our communities of their most valuable resource : healthy people .
One such disease is malaria .
To be sure , Africa has lately made significant progress in combating malaria .
From 2010 to 2015 , as part of the global Millennium Development Goals , the continent reduced the malaria incidence rate ( the number of new infections ) by 21 % and malaria deaths by 31 % .
But malaria remains a serious threat to the wellbeing of millions of Africans .
In 2015 , an estimated 212 million people contracted malaria worldwide , with 47 % of cases concentrated in just six African countries .
An estimated 429,000 people – mostly children under five years of age – died from malaria that year , with 92 % of those deaths occurring in Africa and 40 % occurring in just two countries , Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo .
There is , therefore , an urgent need to accelerate progress – and end malaria for good .
This is both a moral and economic imperative .
Preventable illnesses and deaths limit the ability of communities to contribute to Africa ’ s much-needed economic transformation .
In many African countries , malaria reduces GDP growth by one percentage point per year .
The effort to end malaria can therefore not be separated from the effort to ensure prosperity across Africa .
The Copenhagen Consensus think tank estimates that every dollar invested in ending malaria yields $ 36 in economic returns .
To reap these benefits , African countries must increase domestic-resource mobilization substantially .
Africa ’ s private sector , in particular , has a crucial role to play in developing innovative solutions that address malaria ’ s growing resistance to existing drugs , as well as mosquitoes ’ growing resistance to insecticides .
Moreover , the private sector can help to address inefficiencies in supply-chain management and logistics , thereby facilitating distribution of insecticides and long-lasting insecticidal nets .
Of course , even with private-sector investment , progress toward eradicating malaria in Africa will be uneven , not least because different countries are at different points on the path .
Senegal – where the share of malaria-related outpatient visits fell from 36 % in 2001 to just 3.3 % last year – is now on track to achieve so-called pre-elimination by 2020 .
Meanwhile , other African countries – such as Angola and Somalia – are struggling to make any progress at all , as indicated in the ALMA scorecard for accountability and action .
No single African country can reliably eliminate malaria so long as the disease remains rampant among its neighbors .
Malaria does not , after all , respect borders .
That is why it is vital for African governments to work together , using every tool at their disposal , to achieve comprehensive malaria control , pre-elimination , and , ultimately , elimination .
ALMA – a coalition of 49 African heads of state and government working to eliminate malaria by 2030 – aims to advance precisely such cooperation , by focusing on accountability and action at the national , regional , and global levels .
ALMA provides management tools , such as the scorecard for accountability and action , that help to track progress , identify obstacles and bottlenecks , and advance solutions .
These tools are versatile and adaptable throughout the continent .
Where needed , ALMA has provided support to address challenges directly with countries , in cooperation with partners , or through results-based management structures .
The Ecobank Foundation is also doing its part : its investment of both cash and in-kind services and training have enhanced the impact of the Global Fund partnership in Africa .
By helping to strengthen the financial-management capabilities of grant recipients in Nigeria , Senegal , and South Sudan , the foundation is unlocking funding for health programs in those countries – and is now expanding its support to Chad and Zambia .
And there is more .
Through its digital financial platform , the Ecobank Foundation is leveraging its presence to bring in new funding for the fight against malaria .
And it is raising awareness as well , among its own staff and other stakeholders , of how to support malaria prevention , including through mosquito nets and a clean environment .
The goal of eradicating malaria in our lifetime may sound ambitious , but it is achievable .
Together , Africa ’ s governments and private sector can produce the investment and action needed to stop the disease for good – and ensure greater prosperity across the continent .

Africa ’ s Schooling Without Learning
ACCRA – As the school year began this September , there was welcome news for Ghana ’ s nearly half-million students entering high school : President Nana Akufo-Addo had fulfilled his campaign promise of free secondary education for children nationwide .
