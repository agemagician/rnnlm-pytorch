The Cup ’ s organization has been exceptional ( as was to be expected ) , with excellent police work giving hooligans hardly a chance .
The whole of Germany has been celebrating a never-ending party with guests from all over the world ( which was not expected ) .
And the German team has put on a wonderful display of heart warming and modern offensive soccer ( which nobody could have expected ! ) .
More importantly , not only in the German team , but also in the country as a whole , a young , cool , laid-back , and carefree Germany is raising its head – a Germany that is cosmopolitan , friendly , and good-humored .
Years of bad news appear to have passed the Germans by without a trace .
Doctors are on strike , taxes are on the rise , the parties in government are mauling each other , and Chancellor Angela Merkel herself proclaimed in a prominent speech that the country is in disastrous shape .
But the Germans , undaunted by it all , simply keep celebrating one great soccer party with their newfound friends from all over the world .
The black , red , and gold German tricolor adorns the entire country as never before , but almost nowhere are there nationalist undertones .
In fact , the flags of many nations fly alongside German .
In Berlin , as in other large German cities , taxis sport the flags of their drivers ’ home countries – from Angola to Saudi Arabia .
Fans don not just their nations ’ flags , but also fantastic costumes evocative of their home countries ’ colors .
Flags are flown in hope of victory , but also serve to dry the tears of defeat .
In short , Germany during the World Cup is reminiscent of a Shakespearean midsummer night ’ s dream , with a touch of Woodstock to boot .
Outside the stadiums , public screenings of the games have become joyous mass “ happenings . ”
And how is the soccer ?
This World Cup demonstrates three main developments that the sport has undergone .
First , Europe and South America are more dominant than four years ago and remain the unchallenged great powers of international soccer .
So we must hope that the World Cup in South Africa in 2010 will finally bring greater global parity .
Second , international soccer is witnessing the advent of a new generation .
Spain , Argentina , and Germany , to name but a few countries , have put forward very young teams that have played an impressive game .
On the French , English , and Portuguese teams , too , it is the young players that have shone – despite the continuing presence of Zidane , Beckham , and Figo .
Even the Brazilian squad is looking more aggressive and likely to score with young players like Robinho and Juninho than with their aging champions from 2002 .
This generational change is accelerated by a third development .
At the top international level , soccer has become faster and more athletic , and the top teams can shrink space on the field more effectively .
A team that is unable to keep going at full speed for the full 90 ( or more ) minutes , switch from defense to offense quickly with the whole team , and maintain control of the ball to restrict their opponents &apos; movements won ’ t stand much of a chance .
Here , soccer parallels today ’ s globalized markets , which make similar restructuring of national economies necessary .
Unlike economic globalization , however , it remains to be seen whether this new , fast-paced style of soccer will prevail ( after all , the young blood of Spain lost to the Old Boys of France ) .
The sport and its fans will certainly profit if it does .
For now , we have a World Cup filled with soccer that is being shaped by a new , young generation both on and off the playing field – light-hearted , enthralling , and beautiful to watch .
Let ’ s hope that when the last whistle blows at the final in Berlin on July 9 , we Germans retain as much of this positive spirit as possible .
Germany urgently needs this kind of optimism , because , unfortunately , two universal principles will continue to apply in the future : first , the winter will return , and , second , the ball is round and the next game is always the most difficult .
A Flock of Black Swans
CAMBRIDGE – Throughout history , major political and economic shocks have often occurred in August , when leaders have gone on vacation believing that world affairs are quiet .
Consider World War I ’ s outbreak in 1914 , the Nazi-Soviet pact in 1939 , the Sputnik launch in 1957 , the Berlin Wall in 1961 , and the failed coup in Moscow of 1991 .
Then there was the Nixon shock of 1971 ( when the American president took the dollar off the gold standard and imposed wage , price , and trade controls ) , the 1982 international debt crisis in Mexico , the 1992 crisis in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism , and the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis in the United States .
Many of these shocks constituted events that had previously been considered unthinkable .
They were not even on the radar screen .
Such developments have been called “ black swans ” – events of inconceivably tiny probability .
But , in my view , “ black swan ” should refer to something else : an event that is considered virtually impossible by those whose frame of reference is limited in time and geographical area , but not by those who consider other countries and other decades or centuries .
The origin of the black swan metaphor was the belief that all swans are white , a conclusion that a nineteenth-century Englishman might have reached based on a lifetime of personal observation and David Hume ’ s principle of induction .
But ornithologists already knew that black swans existed in Australia , having discovered them in 1697 . They should not have been viewed as “ unthinkable . ”
Before September 11 , 2001 , some experts warned that foreign terrorists might try to blow up American office buildings .
Those in power did not take these warnings seriously . After all , “ it had never happened before . ”
Many Americans did not know the history of terrorist events in other countries and other decades .
Likewise , until 2006 , most Americans based their economic behavior on the assumption that nominal housing prices , even if they slowed , would not fall , because they had not done so before – within living memory in the US .
They may not have been aware that housing prices had often fallen in other countries , and in the US before the 1940 ’ s .
Needless to say , many indebted homeowners and leveraged bank executives would have made very different decisions had they thought that there was a non-negligible chance of an outright decline in prices .
From 2004 to 2006 , financial markets perceived market risk as very low .
This was most apparent in the implicit volatilities in options prices such as the VIX .
But it was also manifest in junk-bond spreads , sovereign spreads , and many other financial prices .
One reason for this historic mispricing of risk is that traders ’ models went back only a few years , or at most a few decades ( the period of the late “ Great Moderation ” ) .
Traders should have gone back much further – or better yet , formed judgments based on a more comprehensive assessment of what risks might confront the world economy .
Starting in August 2007 , supposedly singular black swans begin to multiply quickly .
“ Big banks don ’ t fail ? ”
No comment .
“ Governments of advanced countries don ’ t default ? ”
Enough said .
Debt troubles in Greece , especially , should not have surprised anyone , least of all northern Europeans .
But , even when the Greek crisis erupted , leaders in Brussels and Frankfurt failed to recognize it as a close cousin of the Argentine crisis of 2001-2002 , the Mexican crisis of 1994 , and many others in history , including among European countries .
Nowadays , a eurozone breakup has become one of the most widely discussed possible shocks .
Considered unthinkable just a short time ago , the probability that one or more euro members will drop out is now well above 50 % .
A hard landing in China and other emerging markets is another possibility .
An oil crisis in the Mideast is the classic black-swan event .
Each one catches us by surprise : 1956 , 1973 , 1979 , 1990 .
Oil prices can rise for many other reasons , as they have in recent years .
But the most likely crisis scenarios currently stem from either military conflict with Iran or instability in some Arab country .
The threat of a supply shock typically fuels a sharp increase in demand for oil inventories – and thus in prices .
The most worrisome financial threat is that currently over-priced bond markets will crash .
In theory , inflation ( particularly commodity-induced inflation , as in 1973 or 1979 ) could precipitate a collapse .
But this seems unlikely .
Default in some euro countries or political dysfunction in the US is a much more likely trigger .
Evidence of extreme dysfunction in US politics is already plain to see , reaching a low in 2011 during the debt-ceiling showdown ( also in August ) , which cost America its AAA sovereign rating from Standard &amp; Poor ’ s .
In theory , as the “ fiscal cliff ” set for January 1 , 2013 , approaches , fearful investors should start dumping bonds now .
But investors still believe that politicians , aware of the dire consequences of going over the cliff , will again find a last-minute way to avoid it .
Perhaps observers believe that a clear result in November ’ s elections , one way or the other , would help to settle things .
A true black swan – low probability , but high enough to think about – would be a repeat of the disputed 2000 presidential election .
There has been no reform since then to ensure that people ’ s votes will be counted or that a disputed outcome will not be resolved by political appointees .
Scariest on the black-swan list is a terrorist attack with weapons of mass destruction .
There is a long-standing gap between terrorism experts ’ perception of the probability of a nuclear event and the probability as perceived by the public .
( Admittedly , the risk is lower now that Osama bin Laden is dead . )
Last on the list is an unprecedented climate disaster .
Environmentalists sometimes underestimate the benefits of technological and economic progress when they reason that a finite supply of resources must imply their eventual exhaustion .
But it is equally mistaken to believe that a true climate disaster cannot happen simply because one has not already occurred .
Have a nice vacation .
A Foreign Policy for New and Old Europe
Watching the news from Iraq , I recall when I was Poland &apos;s Prime Minister during the Gulf War in 1991 .
I watched from home on CNN as the first cruise missiles hit Baghdad .
Hours later our military informed me that armed conflict was underway in Iraq . ``Yes , I know , &apos; &apos; I said . ``I &apos;ve been watching the bombardment on TV . &apos; &apos;
Twelve years later , Poland &apos;s Prime Minister didn &apos;t need a belated call from his military to know that war was underway in Iraq .
All the details of the attack were provided in advance by the US , now Poland &apos;s NATO ally .
Indeed , Poland has secured a leading role in Iraq &apos;s occupation .
What a distance Poland has travelled since communism &apos;s collapse in 1989 !
Little of this , however , is the result of design , for ( unfortunately ) we in Poland have not thought through what sort of foreign policy we need as a member of NATO and putative member of the European Union .
We remain narrowly focussed on whether an initiative will be immediately good or bad for us .
Couple this with a form of foreign policy schizophrenia--some Poles think that by ``simply existing &apos; &apos; we influence Europe &apos;s fate ; others suffer crippling pessimism , consigning Poland to permanent ``second-class &apos; &apos; status--and you have a recipe for inertia .
Our attitude seems to be that somehow things will sort themselves out .
Much of Europe seems to be stuck in the same mindset : we say that we want a common foreign and security policy , but we do nothing about it until a crisis emerges .
Then we squabble about what to do .
The time for such laxity is over .
For Poland and the other countries of East-Central Europe that have or are about to join NATO , membership in the Alliance didn &apos;t really require debate .
Our histories of oppression by powerful neighbours told us that collective security within NATO was the only real option .
EU membership and the global war on terror , however , demand a more deeply considered response .
Why ?
Because EU membership affects every aspect of a state , economy , and society , while the war on terror demands a completely new way to conduct diplomacy and security policy .
Today &apos;s crisis in transatlantic relations , and our accidental involvement in it as part of Donald Rumsfeld &apos;s ``New Europe , &apos; &apos; means that Poland ( like every other European state ) must now decide what it really wants from the EU and NATO .
We must consider both our attitude to global problems that were once deemed peripheral to European interests , as well what it really means to be an EU partner .
Only answers to these questions can reconcile the divide between the ``new &apos; &apos; and ``old &apos; &apos; Europe , as well as the new and old Atlantic worlds .
Poland as an ally of the US is not the real headache facing President Jacques Chirac or Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder .
Instead , the French and German leaders are really responding to the growing unpredictability of today &apos;s emerging European order .
They see new players ( say , Spain ) rising to shape EU policy , particularly foreign policy , and sense that their traditional leadership is being challenged .
But an EU with 10 new members simply cannot be run as it has for decades .
So the challenge to France and Germany does not arise because Poland is some sort of American ``Trojan Horse . &apos; &apos;
Instead , the EU &apos;s structure now demands not only a new consensus about Europe &apos;s role in the world , but also new means to achieve consensus .
History cannot be put on hold as Europe sorts out its internal balance of power .
The world needs a united continent , ready to go into action .
That consensus must include the US .
During the Cold War , most Europeans tolerated America &apos;s tendency to lead unilaterally , because of the Soviet threat and the preponderance of US power .
But America is having a hard time understanding the new circumstances of the post-Cold war era .
Its difficulties are exacerbated by the dramatic disparity in military forces on either side of the Atlantic , and its belief that Europe &apos;s ambitions to become a military power will come to nothing because Europeans won &apos;t spend the money necessary to achieve that goal .
Here is where Poland can help bridge the Atlantic divide and forge a European consensus .
September 1939 taught every Pole that military power must be real to be effective .
Intentions don &apos;t deter invasions .
As Danish Premier Anders Fogh Rasmussen recently said , ``France and Germany are not in a position to guarantee our country &apos;s security .
The US is , but security does not come free of charge . &apos; &apos;
Most Poles think that Poland &apos;s situation is akin to Denmark &apos;s .
Indeed , all of Europe is in thrall to American power .
But this dependence should not disguise the fact that there is a commonality of foreign policy interests between Europe and America .
If the EU builds its foreign and security policy on the basis of recognition of this truth , many of today &apos;s divisions will disappear .
The EU &apos;s foreign policy should be guided by the following goals :
fight terrorism ;
prevent local conflict ;
promote human rights and democracy ;
oblige unpredictable countries to become responsible ;
maintain close cooperation between Europe and the US ;
help poor countries .
Polish foreign policy , like that of the EU , can only be effective in the long term if it takes realistic steps--and spends the necessary money--to realize these objectives .
They are the only possible bedrock in transatlantic relations , in an expanded Union , and in relations between the ``New &apos; &apos; and ``Old &apos; &apos; Europe .
A Fracking Good Story
PRAGUE – Weather conditions around the world this summer have provided ample fodder for the global warming debate .
Droughts and heat waves are a harbinger of our future , carbon cuts are needed now more than ever , and yet meaningful policies have not been enacted .
But , beyond this well-trodden battlefield , something amazing has happened : Carbon-dioxide emissions in the United States have dropped to their lowest level in 20 years .
Estimating on the basis of data from the US Energy Information Agency ( EIA ) from the first five months of 2012 , this year ’ s expected CO2 emissions have declined by more than 800 million tons , or 14 % , from their peak in 2007 .
The cause is an unprecedented switch to natural gas , which emits 45 % less carbon per energy unit .
The US used to generate about half its electricity from coal , and roughly 20 % from gas .
Over the past five years , those numbers have changed , first slowly and now dramatically : in April of this year , coal ’ s share in power generation plummeted to just 32 % , on par with gas .
America ’ s rapid switch to natural gas is the result of three decades of technological innovation , particularly the development of hydraulic fracturing , or “ fracking , ” which has opened up large new resources of previously inaccessible shale gas .
Despite some legitimate concerns about safety , it is hard to overstate the overwhelming benefits .
For starters , fracking has caused gas prices to drop dramatically .
Adjusted for inflation , gas has not been this cheap for the past 35 years , with the price this year 3-5 times lower than it was in the mid-2000 ’ s .
And , while a flagging economy may explain a small portion of the drop in US carbon emissions , the EIA emphasizes that the major explanation is natural gas .
The reduction is even more impressive when one considers that 57 million additional energy consumers were added to the US population over the past two decades .
Indeed , US carbon emissions have dropped some 20 % per capita , and are now at their lowest level since Dwight D. Eisenhower left the White House in 1961 .
David Victor , an energy expert at the University of California , San Diego , estimates that the shift from coal to natural gas has reduced US emissions by 400-500 megatonnes ( Mt ) of CO2 per year .
To put that number in perspective , it is about twice the total effect of the Kyoto Protocol on carbon emissions in the rest of the world , including the European Union .
It is tempting to believe that renewable energy sources are responsible for emissions reductions , but the numbers clearly say otherwise .
Accounting for a reduction of 50 Mt of CO2 per year , America ’ s 30,000 wind turbines reduce emissions by just one-tenth the amount that natural gas does .
Biofuels reduce emissions by only ten Mt , and solar panels by a paltry three Mt .
This flies in the face of conventional thinking , which continues to claim that mandating carbon reductions – through cap-and-trade or a carbon tax – is the only way to combat climate change .
But , based on Europe ’ s experience , such policies are precisely the wrong way to address global warming .
Since 1990 , the EU has heavily subsidized solar and wind energy at a cost of more than $ 20 billion annually .
Yet its per capita CO2 emissions have fallen by less than half of the reduction achieved in the US – even in percentage terms , the US is now doing better .
Because of broad European skepticism about fracking , there is no gas miracle in the EU , while the abundance of heavily subsidized renewables has caused over-achievement of the CO2 target .
Along with the closure of German nuclear power stations , this has led , ironically , to a resurgence of coal .
Well-meaning US politicians have likewise shown how not to tackle global warming with subsidies and tax breaks .
The relatively small reduction in emissions achieved through wind power costs more than $ 3.3 billion annually , and far smaller reductions from ethanol ( biofuels ) and solar panels cost at least $ 8.5 and $ 3 billion annually .
Estimates suggest that using carbon taxes to achieve a further 330 Mt CO2 reduction in the EU would cost $ 250 billion per year .
Meanwhile , the fracking bonanza in the US not only delivers a much greater reduction for free , but also creates long-term social benefits through lower energy costs .
The amazing truth is that fracking has succeeded where Kyoto and carbon taxes have failed .
As shown in a study by the Breakthrough Institute , fracking was built on substantial government investment in technological innovation for three decades .
Climate economists repeatedly have pointed out that such energy innovation is the most effective climate solution , because it is the surest way to drive the price of future green energy sources below that of fossil fuels .
By contrast , subsidizing current , ineffective solar power or ethanol mostly wastes money while benefiting special interests .
Fracking is not a panacea , but it really is by far this decade ’ s best green-energy option .
A Free Lunch for America
BERKELEY – Former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers had a good line at the International Monetary Fund meetings this year : governments , he said , are trying to treat a broken ankle when the patient is facing organ failure .
Summers was criticizing Europe ’ s focus on the second-order issue of Greece while far graver imbalances – between the EU ’ s north and south , and between reckless banks ’ creditors and governments that failed to regulate properly – worsen with each passing day .
But , on the other side of the Atlantic , Americans have no reason to feel smug .
Summers could have used the same metaphor to criticize the United States , where the continued focus on the long-run funding dilemmas of social insurance is sucking all of the oxygen out of efforts to deal with America ’ s macroeconomic and unemployment crisis .
The US government can currently borrow for 30 years at a real ( inflation-adjusted ) interest rate of 1 % per year .
Suppose that the US government were to borrow an extra $ 500 billion over the next two years and spend it on infrastructure – even unproductively , on projects for which the social rate of return is a measly 25 % per year .
Suppose that – as seems to be the case – the simple Keynesian government-expenditure multiplier on this spending is only two .
In that case , the $ 500 billion of extra federal infrastructure spending over the next two years would produce $ 1 trillion of extra output of goods and services , generate approximately seven million person-years of extra employment , and push down the unemployment rate by two percentage points in each of those years .
And , with tighter labor-force attachment on the part of those who have jobs , the unemployment rate thereafter would likely be about 0.1 percentage points lower in the indefinite future .
The impressive gains don ’ t stop there .
Better infrastructure would mean an extra $ 20 billion a year of income and social welfare .
A lower unemployment rate into the future would mean another $ 20 billion a year in higher production .
And half of the extra $ 1 trillion of goods and services would show up as consumption goods and services for American households .
In sum , on the benefits side of the equation : more jobs now , $ 500 billion of additional consumption of goods and services over the next two years , and then a $ 40 billion a year flow of higher incomes and production each year thereafter .
So , what are the likely costs of an extra $ 500 billion in infrastructure spending over the next two years ?
For starters , the $ 500 billion of extra government spending would likely be offset by $ 300 billion of increased tax collections from higher economic activity .
So the net result would be a $ 200 billion increase in the national debt .
American taxpayers would then have to pay $ 2 billion a year in real interest on that extra national debt over the next 30 years , and then pay off or roll over the entire $ 200 billion .
The $ 40 billion a year of higher economic activity would , however , generate roughly $ 10 billion a year in additional tax revenue .
Using some of it to pay the real interest on the debt and saving the rest would mean that when the bill comes due , the tax-financed reserves generated by the healthier economy would be more than enough to pay off the additional national debt .
In other words , taxpayers win , because the benefits from the healthier economy would more than compensate for the costs of servicing the higher national debt , enabling the government to provide more services without raising tax rates .
Households win , too , because they get to buy more and nicer things with their incomes .
Companies win , because goods and workers get to use the improved infrastructure .
The unemployed win , because some of them get jobs .
And even bond investors win , because they get their money back , with the interest for which they contracted .
So what is not to like ?
Nothing .
How , you might ask , can I say this ?
I am an economist – a professor of the Dismal Science , in which there are no free lunches , in which benefits are always balanced by costs , and in which stories that sound too good to be true almost inevitably are .
But there are two things different about today .
First , the US labor market is failing so badly that expanded government spending carries no resource cost to society as a whole .
Second , bond investors are being really stupid .
In a world in which the S &amp; P 500 has a 7 % annual earnings yield , nobody should be happy holding a US government 30-year inflation-adjusted bond that yields 1 % per year .
That six-percentage-point difference in anticipated real yield is a measure of bond investors ’ extraordinary and irrational panic .
They are willing to pay 6 % per year for “ safety . ”
Right now , however , the US government can manufacture “ safety ” out of thin air merely by printing bonds .
The government , too , would then win by pocketing that 6 % per year of value – though 30 years from now , bondholders who feel like winners now would most likely look at their portfolios ’ extraordinarily poor performance of over 2011-2041 and rue their strategy .
A French Cure for the Resource Curse
NEW YORK – The campaign to ensure that companies engaged in extractive activities disclose all of their payments in their host countries is gaining momentum – and France is leading the effort .
President Nicolas Sarkozy should be applauded for supporting a new initiative promoting strict transparency standards for petroleum , gas , and mining companies listed on European stock exchanges .
France , at the heart of the European Union and President of both the G-8 and G-20 this year , is in an exceptional position to encourage such a regulatory move .
With French leadership , 2011 offers a golden opportunity for the most important capital markets to adopt clear , precise rules requiring full financial disclosure by extractive-industry companies to governmental authorities .
Oil , gas , and mining generate billions of dollars per year for governments and companies .
Moreover , these industries often play a central role in the economic development of resource-rich countries .
Yet , despite great natural wealth , a majority of people in these countries lives in poverty .
The actual taxes and payments made by mining , oil , and other extractive-industry companies to governments are usually a well-kept secret , even though most of these governments claim to use the revenue for the public good .
In reality , in far too many countries , ordinary citizens do not benefit from any of this money ; in fact , they must bear the brunt of the environmental and social costs imposed by mining and drilling operations .
Indeed , these well-kept industry and government secrets can have serious and widespread repercussions .
Witness the upheaval in North Africa and the Middle East .
In these countries , many of which are rich in oil and gas , citizens are staging protests against corruption and political repression .
At bottom , they are protesting against the mismanagement of their countries ’ wealth and resources – with implications that affect the security and affordability of the entire world ’ s energy supplies .
Transparency is an essential part of the solution .
Citizens everywhere must be assured that oil and gas firms , as well as mining companies , publish all of their relevant financial information , broken down by country and by project , and including all payments made to host-country public budgets .
If European regulators can agree on this requirement for all extractive-industry companies listed on their stock exchanges , this transparency norm will be applied to companies regardless of where their headquarters are located .
Regulators must also stipulate that company reports be made available on a regular , timely basis , and that they are easily accessible and comparable across countries and other extractive companies .
The United States has already passed legislation requiring public disclosure of payments to governments , through the 2010 Dodd-Frank law .
That law ’ s requirement that companies fully disclose their revenue streams by country and by project applies to 90 % of international oil and gas companies and to eight of the ten largest mining companies .
This will help citizens track how that money is used , but it will not help them to assess whether their governments are collecting a fair share .
If the EU were to require companies to publish detailed information regarding production and operational numbers , financial and accounting balances , and payments to authorities , companies would become truly accountable to citizens , and government revenues would be augmented .
Such regulatory reform is now under consideration by the European Commission , and French support is imperative if the EU is to announce this month the necessary legislative moves to promote transparency .
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde recently highlighted the necessity of promoting “ initiatives within industrial sectors that aim to enhance governance , integrity , and transparency in economic transactions . ”
At its just-completed summit in Deauville , France , the G-8 called for the first time for mandatory reporting by oil , gas , and mining companies .
This is an important advance , but , unfortunately , it is qualified by language that allows voluntary approaches as an alternative , and it focuses only on payments transparency .
Now the world must look to the G-20 summit in Cannes this November to make an unequivocal commitment to the reporting requirements needed , given that important emerging economies such as Brazil , India , and China , as well as South Africa and other resource-rich African countries , will be at the table .
The importance of financial transparency in the extractive industries is not limited to one country or era – and it is too important to be left to voluntary efforts alone .
Greater accountability and stronger governance for such companies could potentially change lives , economies , and political systems around the world .
A French Election American-Style
PARIS – Primary elections in France ?
The idea that a large number of voters should designate the presidential candidates of the major political parties was born in the United States , and we French have long believed that such things were American to the core .
But has the political primary now been successfully transplanted to Europe ?
Until recently , nothing would have appeared more foreign to French political culture .
Choosing candidates has been an affair confined solely to political parties .
The idea of ​ ​ a public “ tournament ” to select a party ’ s nominee was first proposed in the 1980 ’ s by the right-wing politician Charles Pasqua , but without success .
It was ultimately the usually more America-phobic French left that successfully adopted the practice in 1995 , in order to nominate Lionel Jospin for president , and then , in a more dramatic chain of events , to nominate Sègoléne Royal in 2006 .
But neither was as monumental as the Socialists ’ most recent primary .
Based on the Italian experience – also on the political left – of 2005 and 2007 , the Socialist party has , in effect , decided that its candidate for the 2012 presidential election would be decided on the basis of an expanded primary .
Not only would registered Socialist voters be able to participate ; so would all voters who agree to sign a moral charter attesting to the values of the left and were willing to donate a nominal sum of one euro to the party .
The Socialists had initially envisioned a process , following the American example , which was to include successive votes , beginning at the departmental level before continuing to a nationwide poll .
But , given France ’ s size , the party finally decided that it was preferable to limit itself to one national vote , but in two stages , which took place on October 9 and 16 .
Of course , protests were raised , notably from the right , regarding the primary ’ s constitutionality , the legitimacy of using public facilities for a “ private ” election , and the legality of using electoral lists that sometimes include confidential information .
But , while the participants represented only a limited part of the electorate , 2.6 million voted in the first round , and more than three million in the subsequent run-off between the two top candidates , confirming broad public acceptance of the process as legitimate and valuable .
Further affirming the primary ’ s importance , the three debates between the six candidates before the first round of voting , and the debate between the final two candidates , Martine Aubry and François Holland , attracted a large television audience .
Indeed , the debates ’ high ratings had the unintended consequence of allowing the Socialist party to dominate France ’ s media landscape for weeks .
It thus appears that the introduction of primaries represents an important innovation that gives to citizens a new way to participate in and contribute to public life .
In fact , at a time of widespread alienation from the institutions of representative democracy , direct citizen participation in nominating candidates is probably an irreversible trend .
This is particularly true in the case of presidential elections , which have been regarded since 1962 as the key to the legitimacy of all French political institutions .
Although President Nicolas Sarkozy recently opposed the use of primary elections in his own party , many of those responsible for his legislative majority , including Prime Minister Francois Fillon , seem to consider it likely that the French right will also begin the practice of using political primaries , if not in 2012 ( because Sarkozy will run again ) , then in 2017 .
But there are risks to embracing primaries .
For one thing , they increase the personalization of political power , which can overwhelm established codes of civility .
True , despite certain contested events in the days preceding the Socialist run-off , the level of brutishness among candidates was limited .
But it is certain that arguments used in the primaries against Holland , the ultimate winner , will be re-used the moment the presidential election campaign begins .
More generally , it remains to be seen how willing the rival candidates in party primaries will be to reunite under the same political banner for the election .
As in the US , however , lingering divisiveness may be a price worth paying for a tool with which to renew the principles and practice of the democratic spirit .
A French Presidential Primer
The late British Prime Minister Harold Wilson used to quip that “ a week is a long time in politics . ”
So , in the 30 or so weeks between now and the next French presidential election , any prediction made today could be reversed , and reversed again , before the vote .
But two candidates have emerged as clear and constant favorites in opinion polls : Nicolas Sarkozy on the right and Ségolène Royal on the left .
In fact , they have more in common than meets the eye , for each speaks of a rupture with the past while incarnating a form of continuity .
For Sarkozy , “ rupture ” reflects both mundanely tactical and deeply personal choices .
The 12 years of Jacques Chirac ‘ s presidency , together with France ’ s tradition of alternation in power , suggests a victory for the left .
Positioning himself as the candidate who represents a sharp break with today ’ s unpopular politics is the only means to escape that fate .
This is reflected in Sarkozy ’ s openly pro-American stance – an act of political courage in a France where anti-Americanism is running high .
Sarkozy ’ s message is that Chirac and Villepin were right in substance to oppose America ’ s military adventure in Iraq , but that their style was disastrously wrong .
Thus , his deep admiration for “ American values , ” while sincere , implies no embrace of President George W. Bush .
It also reassures the French business community , which was shocked by Dominique de Villepin ’ s flamboyant opposition to the United States when he was Chirac ’ s foreign minister .
At home , Sarkozy has aimed his message particularly at the young , issuing a patriotic call to the values of work and discipline , a counter-revolutionary revolution .
The revolution that must be overcome is that of May 1968 , whose leaders and supporters , according to Sarkozy , may have lost politically to de Gaulle , but deeply weakened France over the succeeding decades with their emphasis on “ false values . ”
By contrast , rebelling against one ’ s parents ’ generation and rediscovering traditional moral stances will save France – a message that is highly applicable to issues , such as education and immigration , that may dominate the electoral campaign .
In the case of Royal , the meaning of “ rupture ” is both more obvious and more visible .
She is seeking to become the first woman President of the French Republic .
To achieve her goal , she prefers to emphasize her “ essence , ” thereby countering Sarkozy ’ s stress on his record as a “ doer . ”
Her appeal to voters is simple : “ I am a woman , and you have never tried a woman , so be modern and try one now . ”
Hiding behind the originality ( in French presidential politics ) of her gender , Royal has avoided specifying a detailed program .
When challenged by inquisitive journalists demanding greater precision about her policy agenda , her highly effective line of defense ( so far ! ) has been : “ You would not dare to ask me such a question if I were not a woman ! ”
Thus , Royal ’ s program is her popularity .
In foreign policy , one can only guess what her priorities would be .
As far as Europe is concerned , she seems as “ agnostic ” as Sarkozy , who , like her , incarnates a new generation of “ post-European ” leaders .
In terms of values , Royal , too , seems to represent a rupture with May 1968 , with her emphasis on discipline and family .
According to public opinion polls , Royal is the clear favorite of the left and the only candidate able to defeat Sarkozy .
Her support is particularly strong among women voters .
For the Socialist Party , which is eager to return to power but has not yet recovered from the humiliating defeat of Lionel Jospin in the first round of the presidential election in 2002 , the question is whether it can afford to resist the wave of favorable public opinion behind Royal .
In the opinion of Royal ’ s many opponents among Socialist leaders and militants , the dominance of the media in the political process is leading to mediocrity : the qualities required to be elected are becoming nearly incompatible with those needed to govern .
According to Royal ’ s Socialist critics , the “ Hollywoodization ” of politics from which she benefits entails a new approach in which leaders follow and followers lead .
But the same criticism can be directed at Sarkozy .
Moreover , both candidates embody continuity – with Chirac ’ s Gaullist side for Sarkozy and with François Mitterrand for Royal – as much as rupture .
Royal openly claims Mitterand ’ s legacy as she searches for legitimacy , while Sarkozy ’ s rejection of Chirac ’ s legacy has more to do with form than substance .
To a large extent , Sarkozy can be seen as Chirac with more , whereas Royal is clearly Mitterrand with less .
When the voters decide in the spring of 2007 , their choice may depend more on negative than positive considerations , as it did in 2002 , when Chirac faced the odious nationalist Jean-Marie Le Pen in the second round .
As in 2002 , the winner next year will be whomever the electorate dislikes or fears less .
But one way or the other , personalities will prevail over programs .
A Fresh Start for China and Japan ?
Edmonton – Chinese President Hu Jintao will make a high-profile visit to Japan from May 6-10 , making him the second Chinese head of state ever to travel there .
The trip is being carefully managed by both countries , and is being watched closely around the world , with good reason : Sino-Japanese relations over the past decade have been turbulent , to say the least .
When Hu ’ s predecessor , Jiang Zemin , traveled to Japan ten years ago , bilateral relations were deteriorating : China was unhappy with the Japanese government ’ s refusal to extend the same apology offered to South Korea for past aggression ; Japan was worried about a rising China and thus turning more confrontational .
The Japanese media ’ s coverage of the visit was overwhelmingly negative , and it was remembered as a public-relations disaster .
Hu succeeded Jiang in 2002 , almost as former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi was coming to power in Japan , and encouraged “ New Thinking ” in China ’ s Japan policy , which would entail moving away from historical grievances and promoting better ties .
But , instead of accepting China ’ s olive branch , Koizumi implemented a more nationalistic agenda , including annual visits to the Yasukuni Shine , which is regarded as a symbol of Japanese militarism by Japan ’ s neighbors .
His hard-line approach isolated Japan and angered China , leading to an outburst of anti-Japanese demonstrations in China in 2005 .
But both Japan and China recognize that further tension will serve neither country ’ s long-term interests .
Koizumi ’ s successors , Prime Ministers Shinzo Abe and Yasuo Fukuda , have sought to engage China over the past two years , with summits in Beijing and a successful visit by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao to Japan last year .
Hu ’ s trip is likely follow the example set by Wen .
He will emphasize common strategic interests , highlight mutual economic benefits , generate positive public opinion , and promote further exchanges .
Japan is not only one of China ’ s largest trade and investment partners , it is also the most powerful neighbor with which China wants to be on good terms , partly to showcase that China ’ s rise is not a threat to Asia and the rest of the world .
Japan , whose economic recovery is attributable largely to its deepening ties with China in recent years , is also eager to demonstrate that it regards China not as a threat but as an opportunity , as least in economic terms .
It was 30 years ago that former Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda , the father of today ’ s prime minister , signed a Peace and Friendship Treaty with China .
The two governments will certainly use Hu ’ s visit to celebrate the anniversary with new programs designed to enhance bilateral understanding and friendship .
But , unlike three decades ago , when the Japanese regarded China as one of their most favored countries , public opinion in both countries nowadays registers more negative feelings than positive ones .
Behind the smiles , the polite interactions , and the cautiously worded diplomatic language , strong undercurrents of suspicion remain .
One problem is the disputed waters of the East China Sea .
Despite new joint projects in energy efficiency and environmental protection , areas in which China ranks Japan as the best performer among industrialized countries , the two sides remain in bitterly divided over these territorial waters , which contain huge potential oil , gas , and other mineral deposits .
Even after many rounds of talks , no resolution is in sight , and Hu ’ s visit is not expected to produce any breakthroughs .
Then there are strategic suspicions .
Fukuda has dropped Abe ’ s talk about an “ arch of freedom ” – an effort to forge a bloc with the United States , Australia , and India .
But Japan remains concerned about China ’ s rapidly modernizing military , while China worries about a potential US-Japan containment strategy for China , especially in the case of a crisis in the Taiwan Straits .
So , although both sides endorse the idea of a “ mutually beneficial strategic relationship , ” and despite progress bilateral on military exchanges , mutual trust and confidence-building have a long way to go .
Moreover , today ’ s “ warm politics , cool economics ” trend is the reverse of the “ cold politics , warm economics ” pattern under Koizumi .
Last year , Japan ’ s committed investment projects in China fell 24 % from 2006 , while actual investment volume decreased by 25 % , partly owing to regulatory changes in China regarding foreign investment .
Recent food safety issues , such as the “ poisoned dumplings ” cases , have clearly heightened the Japanese public ’ s sensitivity about Chinese exports .
Finally , historical issues could still resurface to cause new problems .
While Fukuda has made it clear that he will not visit the Yasukuni Shrine , 160 other parliamentarians paid homage at the site last month , an indication that conservative forces in Japan remain strong and that future prime ministers may not abstain from visiting Yasukuni .
And Japan has so far failed to live up to its treaty obligations to clean up between 700,000 and two million chemical weapons that were abandoned in China by the Japanese army at the end of World War II , another potential flash point if any of these weapons causes casualties in China .
A Fresh Start for Europe in Latin America ?
MILAN – By 2050 , Brazil and Mexico will be among the world ’ s six leading economies , according to analysts at the investment bank Goldman Sachs .
Does the European Union care ?
Is Latin America to be Europe ’ s next missed business opportunity ?
Latin America has a population of 550 million , with average yearly per capita income of $ 4,000 , immense natural resources , and substantial human capital .
It accounts for 8 % of world production and grew by more than 5 % in each of the past three years .
Although the United States remains the main destination of Latin American and Caribbean exports , Asia is becoming an increasingly important market for goods based on natural resources .
During the past four years , Latin America attracted an annual average of $ 61 billion in foreign direct investment , 60 % of which went to Brazil and Mexico .
In the 1990 ’ s , foreign investors were chiefly attracted by privatization programs in the region , but more recently mergers and acquisitions and greenfield projects have been the most common type of investment .
Predictably , Spain is the most important European investor in the region , though several important Spanish operations have recently passed to Italian companies , among them the utility Endesa , acquired by Enel , which is now the biggest private energy distributor in Latin America .
Meanwhile , Latin American businesses have been increasing their own foreign investments .
In 2006 , Brazil invested $ 28.2 billion abroad , compared to inflows of $ 18.8 billion .
Indeed , emerging giants from Latin America and Asia will be at the center of worldwide investment in the coming decades .
In 2006 , Italy ’ s Fiat Group and India ’ s Tata Motors established a joint venture to make passenger vehicles and engines in India .
The following year , they extended their partnership to Latin America , investing $ 80 million in production of a Tata pick-up truck at Fiat ’ s factory in Cordoba , Argentina .
It is to be hoped that many more major European corporations will follow suit .
But small and medium sized enterprises ( SMEs ) – the majority of firms in both Latin America and Europe – find it difficult to trade and invest at international level , in part because of high transaction and information costs .
In Europe , clusters of SMEs appear able to achieve economies of scale and scope , and thus to succeed collectively in global markets .
This European experience is now being widely studied in Latin America .
In Brazil , four local production systems have combined to form Project Promos / Sebrae / BID , based on the example of Italy ’ s industrial districts .
Between 2002 and 2006 , Brazil ’ s SME support services and the Milan Chamber of Commerce created partnerships involving furniture , shoes , designer lingerie , and handicrafts from different regions of the country .
This approach may well be the shape of things to come .
But , while the EU ’ s association agreement with Mexico is 10 years old , it does not yet have a strategic partnership with Brazil .
This is partly because of the never-ending negotiation process with Mercosur , the troubled – and still incomplete – Latin American customs union .
The EU is currently negotiating trade liberalization deals with all of Latin America ’ s regional blocs : Mercosur , the Caribbean Community , the Central America Common Market , and the Andean Community .
The EU must urge its Latin American partners towards further integration .
Adopting a common “ rule of origin ” for their products would be an incentive to liberalize their international trade further , thus increasing it .
Full trade liberalization in Latin America , although difficult to achieve , must be made central to EU strategy , and would boost economic growth .
But even if tariffs and quotas are progressively reduced , trade flows may remain low if other trade costs remain high .
EU cooperation thus should be directed to lowering trade costs .
The crucial issue is market access .
Most Latin American countries still get poor results from their efforts to export to Europe , the exceptions being raw materials and energy resources .
After the establishment of the EU-Chile free-trade area , Chilean exports to the EU increased substantially .
But in the case of EU-Mexico trade liberalization , the growth of imports from the EU has exceeded the growth of exports to Europe , resulting in a widening Mexican trade deficit with the EU .
This is at odds with the EU ’ s proclamations since the 1999 Rio summit that Latin America is a vital political and economic partner .
A change in Europe ’ s approach is needed if a strategic partnership is to be created .
The European Commission understands this .
Although the EU does not have a strategic partnership with Brazil , it intends to push ahead with one as fast as possible .
In mid-2007 , the Commission confirmed that it will revisit the EU ’ s dialogue with Mercosur , with the aim of giving new impetus to negotiations .
But there is also keen awareness that the EU ’ s hope for a special relationship with Brazil must not be allowed to hinder regional integration or worsen asymmetries and imbalances within the bloc .
If Latin America is to become a strategic partner for the EU and a more attractive market for European companies , European institutions must become more open to the region ’ s needs .
A fresh start by the EU with Brazil and Mexico could prove promising , because of the “ pull ” it might have on other countries .
But this must be accompanied by measures to keep all Latin American countries on board .
Otherwise , Latin America may well prove to be Europe ’ s next missed business opportunity .
A Fresh Start for Europe
As Europe ’ s leaders gather in Portugal to put the finishing touches on the new , slimmed down , Reform Treaty , it might be helpful if they all pretended that the last 50 years of European integration had never taken place .
Let ’ s then imagine what Europe needs to do to confront its most pressing challenges , especially if it were able to do so without the political constraints of 50 years of EU deal-making and ramshackle institution-building .
On top of that , let us make a major leap of imagination and suppose that even though this scenario of the EU at “ Year Zero ” means we would not have a half-century of intra-European cooperation to draw on , the nations that today make up the EU would nevertheless be keen to adopt far-reaching joint policies .
Let ’ s suspend our disbelief , then , and try to imagine what Europe could and should be doing to tackle some of the most far-reaching and obstinate policy challenges that will determine whether the next 50 years are as constructive as the last .
Or , to put it another way , let ’ s look at our problems in the light of the EU ’ s existing mechanisms and its potential for creating far-reaching new policies , and then let ’ s ask ourselves why the EU isn ’ t realizing its own potential and delivering the goods .
Broadly , we see three areas in which Europe ’ s policymakers at both the national and EU levels can do better : global challenges where Europe could show greater leadership , the creation and strengthening of human capital within the EU and worldwide , and improvement in the effectiveness of the EU ’ s own political machinery .
Europe needs a clearer and more recognizable global agenda .
It needs to build substantially on its leadership on climate change by adopting much tougher EU goals , and then use its international economic and trade clout to champion new global emissions standards that scientific opinion can accept as meaningful .
On conflict and security issues , Europe should be advancing to a new phase in which it takes much clearer and unambiguous positions on issues ranging from nuclear proliferation to sanctions against Burma ’ s military regime .
The purpose must be to establish Europe as a forceful and fair-minded player on the world stage , rather than as a “ broad church ” in which different viewpoints co-exist .
The aim should be that “ soft power ” instruments like EU development aid and economic partnerships would be linked with a growing sense of political and security outreach to ensure Europe is a global player to be reckoned with .
That means , of course , that the EU should seek to widen its transatlantic thinking so that the EU and the United States cooperate more closely on defining – and thus protecting – their common interests in a world where together they account for little more than 10 % of the total population .
These points are far from a blanket criticism of the EU ’ s efforts to create a common foreign and security policy .
But they are intended to underline what many people in Europe know very well , which is that the speed with which problems concerning international development and conflict are growing easily outpaces the EU ’ s policy responses so far .
Building more human capital in Europe and worldwide is a crucially important element in future EU activities .
Education is by far the most profitable investment Europe can make , so it should be launching its most ambitious strategy ever to create a new knowledge dynamic and employment inside the EU while helping to expand greatly education in the world ’ s poorest countries .
Europe also must at last grasp the nettle of immigration policy – something that has persistently eluded generations of political leaders .
Agreed EU-wide immigration rules are needed to reconcile shrinking Europe ’ s hunger for imported labor with widespread fears of cultural tensions and social unrest .
It won ’ t be easy to create a fairer and more multi-cultural Europe , but failure to address this problem openly will carry an even heavier price .
By much the same token , Europe ’ s governments should be making a determined new effort to strengthen Europeans ’ sense of a shared history and common values .
A stronger European identity is the soundest basis for creating the more multi-cultural society that demographers regard as inevitable .
Meanwhile , doubts still surround the political and institutional machinery the EU will need to realize these and other ambitious goals .
Sighs of relief greeted EU leaders ’ mid-year agreement on a Reform Treaty aimed at overhauling the Union ’ s decision-making mechanisms , but it is still uncertain whether the new pact will survive the ratification process in 27 countries .
We believe , though , that the increased use of qualified majority voting by member governments embodied in the new treaty should also be applied to the ratification process itself .
That way , if a small minority of EU governments prove unable to ratify the treaty , it would not be torpedoed the way that its predecessor , the Constitutional Treaty , was in 2005 .
How to Help the African Dust Bowl
SEATTLE – Picture a small farm under a blazing hot sky .
An intense drought is afflicting the surrounding region , prospects for the next harvest are bleak , and the financial system lacks the capacity to provide the loans farmers need to get by .
This scenario describes today ’ s southern Africa , which is in the grips of an epic drought .
As it happens , it also describes eastern Nebraska in the “ Dust Bowl ” years of the early 1930s – a period through which my own family lived .
My father , Ralph Raikes , was the first in his family to graduate from college .
After working for Standard Oil in California , he stopped by his parents ’ farm on his way to Cambridge , Massachusetts , where he planned to pursue graduate studies at MIT .
He never made it .
He had to stay in Nebraska and help my grandfather save the family farm from the banks , which had already repossessed one-third of the land .
The most important change my father made was in his mindset : he came to think of the farm not as a subsistence operation , but as a family business .
He turned to the University of Nebraska , where he had received his undergraduate degree , and acquired hybrid corn and other improved seeds that the university was developing .
Then he tracked inputs and weather conditions , which was rarely done at that time .
My father realized that he couldn ’ t go it alone , and that he would need better access to financing .
So he helped guide – first as a customer , and later as an adviser and director – Farm Credit , a national banking cooperative network , in its efforts to help local farmers weather the Dust Bowl years .
He also helped found the Nebraska Farm Business Association , which aggregated the data that he and his peers collected , so that they could determine best practices .
And he worked together with my mother , Alice , who ran the family poultry business .
Farm Credit and the University of Nebraska ’ s labs and greenhouses emerged out of United States government programs that had been created to improve the agriculture sector ’ s performance .
That sector was under water in 1933 ; with one-quarter of the population living on farms at the time , more investment was needed .
That year , Congress passed the first “ farm bill , ” the Agricultural Adjustment Act , which boosted investment in the rural economy and helped lift farm income by 50 % within two years .
Federal farm programs treated farming as a business enterprise , enabling businessmen like my father to prosper .
Eighty years later , African farmers need to make the same switch , by treating their subsistence operations as family-owned enterprises .
And , like my father during the Dust Bowl years , they have novel means at their disposal : a wide range of new seeds and other technologies have been developed for African family farms – those with 4-5 acres or less – to use in the field .
In October , a group of scientists received the World Food Prize for producing and disseminating a sweet potato variety that adds vitamin A to Sub-Saharan Africans ’ diets , and other new seed varieties are helping farmers survive the harvest-crushing drought .
But , as a recent report from the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa ( AGRA ) makes clear , government investment must follow the science .
Agriculture comprises almost two-thirds of Sub-Saharan Africa ’ s workforce , and in 2003 the African Union called for countries to increase their investment in the sector to an ambitious 10 % of all government spending .
Only 13 countries answered that call , but their investments – in research and development , services that help farmers take advantage of new research findings , credit and financing initiatives , commodity exchanges , and other marketing efforts – have already paid dividends .
Those 13 countries have experienced marked improvements in agricultural production , per capita GDP , and nutrition .
Government investment paves the way for private-sector investment , and it could be a game-changer for African farmers , who have operated at subsistence levels for far too long .
Only about 6 % of rural households in Sub-Saharan Africa receive loans from financial institutions .
Moreover , almost two-thirds of African farmland soil is missing key nutrients , and many farmers lack the technical knowledge and resources to restore their land ’ s fertility , leaving them unable to take full advantage of new technologies .
African farmers growing new crop varieties are increasing their yields by only 28 % , compared to 88 % for farmers in Asia .
My parents made certain that all five of their children graduated from college .
Like them , farmers everywhere want to ensure that their children lead healthy , prosperous lives ; and they all recognize the importance of education .
The farmers I have met around the world often just want to sell enough extra produce to pay their health bills and put their children through school .
They take advantage of opportunities when they arise , and they position their children to reap larger profits in the future .
One hopes that an American story of economic progress , like that of my family , will soon be an African story , too .
With so many new innovations becoming available , Africa ’ s family farmers need their governments to invest in their future .
If they do , that future will look much better than today ’ s dusty and desperate reality .
Africa at Risk
ADDIS ABABA – Climate change will hit Africa – a continent that has contributed virtually nothing to bring it about – first and hardest .
Aside from Antarctica , Africa is the only continent that has not industrialized .
Indeed , since 1980 ’ s the industrialization that had taken place in Africa has by and large been reversed .
Africa has thus contributed nothing to the historical accumulation of greenhouse gases through carbon-based industrialization .
Moreover , its current contribution is also negligible , practically all of it coming from deforestation and degradation of forests and farmland .
Yet climate change will hit Africa hardest , because it will cripple the continent ’ s vulnerable agricultural sector , on which 70 % of the population depends .
All estimates of the possible impact of global warming suggest that a large part of the continent will become drier , and that the continent as a whole will experience greater climatic variability .
We know what the impact of periodic droughts have been on the lives of tens of millions of Africans .
We can therefore imagine what the impact of a drier climate on agriculture is likely to be .
Conditions in this vital economic sector will become even more precarious than they currently are .
Africa will not only be hit hardest , but it will be hit first .
Indeed , the long dreaded impact of climate change is already upon us .
The current drought covering much of East Africa – far more severe than past droughts – has been directly associated with climate change .
The upcoming climate negotiations ought to address the specific problems of Africa and similarly vulnerable poor parts of the world .
This requires , first and most importantly , reducing global warming to the apparently inevitable increase of two degrees Celsius , beyond which lies an environmental catastrophe that could be unmanageable for poor and vulnerable countries .
Second , adequate resources should be made available to poor and vulnerable regions and countries to enable them to adapt to climate change .
Climate change , which was largely brought about by the activities of developed countries , has made it difficult for poor and vulnerable countries to fight poverty .
It has created a more hostile environment for development .
No amount of money will undo the damage done .
But adequate investment in mitigating the damage could partly resolve the problem .
Developed countries are thus morally obliged to pay partial compensation to poor and vulnerable countries and regions to cover part of the cost of the investments needed to adapt to climate change .
Various estimates have been made of the scale of investment required by those countries .
One conservative estimate – which has a reasonable chance of being accepted precisely because it is conservative – calls for $ 50 billion per year as of 2015 , increasing to $ 100 billion by 2020 and beyond .
A transitional financing arrangement would be put in place for the period 2010-2015 .
Some argue that developed countries cannot come up with such sums , particularly given their current economic challenges .
But no one has so far argued that the cost of damage caused to the development prospects of poor countries and regions is less than the amount of compensation being offered to cover adjustment costs .
The reason is obvious : the damage caused is many times higher than the compensation being requested .
Nonetheless , it is argued , whatever the real cost of the damage , developed countries currently cannot afford to provide that kind of money .
But we all know that these countries and their national banks were able to spend trillions of dollars in a few months to bail out their bankers , who earned super-profits when the going was good .
When the good times ended , taxpayers and governments were prepared to rescue them and to ensure that they continued to receive their extraordinary bonuses .
If the developed world is able to pay trillions of dollars to clean up its bankers ’ mess , how is it possible that it cannot afford to pay billions of dollars to clean up a mess that it created , and that is threatening the survival of whole continents ?
Clearly this is not about the availability of resources .
It is about the inappropriate priorities in how resources are allocated .
It is about moral values that make it appropriate to rescue bankers , who expect everyone but themselves to pay for the mess they created , and inappropriate to compensate the world ’ s poorest people , whose survival is threatened precisely because of the mess created by developed countries .
I cannot believe that people in developed counties , when informed about the issues , would support rescuing bankers and oppose partial compensation for poor countries and regions .
I cannot believe that they will let such an injustice occur .
If they are not expressing their outrage over the injustice of it all , it can only be because they are inadequately informed .
Africa ’ s Latest False Choice
DJIBOUTI – With the rise of Asian economies and their desire to play a greater role on the world stage , it has been suggested that Africa should choose between keeping its partnerships with the West and embracing new alliances with the East .
This is the same false choice that African countries were told that they had to make during the Cold War , when the Soviet Union and the West , led by the United States , competed for exclusive influence across the continent .
The idea that Africa must once again choose between two competing blocs – Chinese and the Western – has become widespread among Western strategists , think tanks , and journalists .
Reducing African options to such a crude choice conjures the specter of a new “ Great Game , ” with foreign powers once again carving up the continent for their benefit .
According to this narrative , Asian investors , particularly the Chinese , will gorge themselves on the continent ’ s resources until nothing is left .
African governments and businesses take a more nuanced view .
In recent years , Western investors have fixed their sights on emerging markets such as Brazil and China , leaving a funding gap for the pioneer markets of Africa .
Many of our Asian partners have been successful in developing their industrial base , something that African countries seek to do as well .
China , after all , is now the world ’ s largest economy ( in terms of purchasing power parity ) , just three decades after opening itself to rapid development .
Meanwhile , economic growth is no longer a distant promise in Africa , but a reality .
According to the World Bank , Sub-Saharan Africa ’ s GDP grew at a 4.7 % annual rate in 2013 , with the pace expected to accelerate to 5.1 % in 2015 and 2016 .
Today , no global investor can afford to ignore Africa ’ s tremendous potential .
Similarly , no developing country should ignore the great opportunities implied by engagement with Asia ’ s emerging powers .
It is only natural that trade and diplomatic relations between two dynamic continents should be on an upward path .
The numbers are impressive .
Exports from Africa to Asia increased more than sixfold between 2001 and 2011 .
Trade between the two continents now almost matches that between Africa and Europe , and China has become Africa ’ s single largest trading partner , with trade flows rising from $ 11 billion in 2000 to $ 210 billion last year .
China ’ s direct investment in Africa has grown from a scant $ 500 million in 2003 to $ 15 billion in 2012 .
And there is plenty of room for further growth .
